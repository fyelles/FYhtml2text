Name
elvtune — I/O elevator tuner

Synopsis

elvtune [ −r r_lat ] [ −w w_lat ] [ −b b_max ] device...

elvtune −h

elvtune −v

 
DESCRIPTION
elvtune
      allows to tune the I/O elevator per blockdevice queue basis.
      The tuning can be safely done at runtime. Tuning the elevator
      means being able to change disk performance and
      interactiveness. In the output of elvtune the address of the
      queue tuned will be shown and it can be considered as a queue
      ID. For example multiple partitions in the same harddisk will
      share the same queue and so tuning one partition will be like
      tuning the whole HD.

 
OPTIONS

−rr_lat

set the max latency that the I/O scheduler will
            provide on each read.

−ww_lat

set the max latency that the I/O scheduler will
            provide on each write.

−bb_max

max coalescing factor allowed on writes when there
            are reads pending in the queue.

−h

help.

−v

version.

 
NOTE
Actually the only fields tunable are those relative to the
      IO scheduler. It's not possible to select a one-way or
      two-way elevator yet.
For logical blockdevices like LVM the tuning has to be
      done on the physical
      devices. Tuning the queue of the LVM logical device is
      useless.

 
RETURN VALUE
0 on success and 1 on failure.

 
HISTORY
Ioctls for tuning elevator behaviour were added in Linux
      2.3.99-pre1.
