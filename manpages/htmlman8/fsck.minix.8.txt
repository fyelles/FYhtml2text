Name
fsck.minix — a file system consistency checker for
      Linux

Synopsis

fsck.minix [−larvsmf] device

 
DESCRIPTION
fsck.minix
      performs a consistency check for the Linux MINIX filesystem.
      The current version supports the 14 character and 30
      character filename options.
The program assumes the file system is quiescent.
      fsck.minix
      should not be used on a mounted device unless you can be sure
      nobody is writing to it (and remember that the kernel can
      write to it when it searches for files).
The device will usually have the following form:

        /dev/hda[1-63] (IDE disk 1)
        /dev/hdb[1-63] (IDE disk 2)
        /dev/sda[1-15] (SCSI disk 1)
        /dev/sdb[1-15] (SCSI disk 2)

If the file system was changed (i.e., repaired), then
      fsck.minix will
      print "FILE SYSTEM HAS CHANGED" and will sync(2) three times before
      exiting. Since Linux does not currently have raw devices,
      there is no need to
      reboot at this time.

 
WARNING
fsck.minix
      should not be used on a mounted filesystem. Using
      fsck.minix on a
      mounted filesystem is very dangerous, due to the possibility
      that deleted files are still in use, and can seriously damage
      a perfectly good filesystem! If you absolutely have to run
      fsck.minix on a
      mounted filesystem (i.e., the root filesystem), make sure
      nothing is writing to the disk, and that no files are
      "zombies" waiting for deletion.

 
OPTIONS

−l

Lists all filenames

−r

Performs interactive repairs

−a

Performs automatic repairs (this option implies
            −r), and serves to
            answer all of the questions asked with the default.
            Note that this can be extremely dangerous in the case
            of extensive file system damage.

−v

Verbose

−s

Outputs super-block information

−m

Activates MINIX-like "mode not cleared" warnings

−f

Force file system check even if the file system was
            marked as valid (this marking is done by the kernel
            when the file system is unmounted).

 
SEE ALSO
fsck(8), fsck.ext(8), fsck.ext2(8), fsck.xiafs(8), mkfs(8), mkfs.minix(8), mkfs.ext(8), mkfs.ext2(8), mkfs.xiafs(8), reboot(8)

 
DIAGNOSTICS
There are numerous diagnostic messages. The ones mentioned
      here are the most commonly seen in normal usage.
If the device does not exist, fsck.minix will print
      "unable to read super block". If the device exists, but is
      not a MINIX file system, fsck.minix will print "bad
      magic number in super-block".

 
EXIT CODES
The exit code returned by fsck.minix is the sum of
      the following:

0

No errors

3

File system errors corrected, system should be
            rebooted if file system was mounted

4

File system errors left uncorrected

8

Operational error

16

Usage or syntax error

In point of fact, only 0, 3, 4, 7, 8, and 16 can ever be
      returned.
