Synopsis

fdformat [−n] device

 
DESCRIPTION
fdformat
      does a low level format on a floppy disk. device is usually one of the
      following (for floppy devices, the major = 2, and the minor
      is shown for informational purposes only):

        /dev/fd0d360  (minor = 4)
        /dev/fd0h1200 (minor = 8)
        /dev/fd0D360  (minor = 12)
        /dev/fd0H360  (minor = 12)
        /dev/fd0D720  (minor = 16)
        /dev/fd0H720  (minor = 16)
        /dev/fd0h360  (minor = 20)
        /dev/fd0h720  (minor = 24)
        /dev/fd0H1440 (minor = 28)
        
        /dev/fd1d360  (minor = 5)
        /dev/fd1h1200 (minor = 9)
        /dev/fd1D360  (minor = 13)
        /dev/fd1H360  (minor = 13)
        /dev/fd1D720  (minor = 17)
        /dev/fd1H720  (minor = 17)
        /dev/fd1h360  (minor = 21)
        /dev/fd1h720  (minor = 25)
        /dev/fd1H1440 (minor = 29)

The generic floppy devices, /dev/fd0 and /dev/fd1, will
      fail to work with fdformat when a
      non-standard format is being used, or if the format has not
      been autodetected earlier. In this case, use setfdprm(8) to load the disk
      parameters.

 
OPTIONS

−n

No verify. This option will disable the verification
            that is performed after the format.
