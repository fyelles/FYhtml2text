Name
slapacl — Check access to a list of attributes.

Synopsis

SBINDIR/slapacl
−b DN [ −d debug−level ] [ −D authcDN | −U authcID ] [ −f slapd.conf ] [ −F confdir ] [ −o option[= value] ] [−u] [−v] [ −X authzID | −o authzDN= DN ] [ attr [ / access][:
        value ] ] [ ... ]

 
DESCRIPTION
slapacl is
      used to check the behavior of slapd(8) by verifying
      access to directory data according to the access control list
      directives defined in its configuration. It opens the
      slapd.conf(5) configuration
      file or the slapd-config(5) backend,
      reads in the access/olcAccess directives, and
      then parses the attr
      list given on the command-line; if none is given, access to
      the entry
      pseudo-attribute is tested.

 
OPTIONS

−b
          DN

specify the DN which access is
            requested to; the corresponding entry is fetched from
            the database, and thus it must exist. The DN is also used to
            determine what rules apply; thus, it must be in the
            naming context of a configured database. See also
            −u.

−d
          debug−level

enable debugging messages as defined by the
            specified debug-level; see
            slapd(8) for
            details.

−D
          authcDN

specify a DN to be used as identity through the test
            session when selecting appropriate <by> clauses in
            access lists.

−f
          slapd.conf

specify an alternative slapd.conf(5)
            file.

−F
          confdir

specify a config directory. If both −f and −F are specified, the config file
            will be read and converted to config directory format
            and written to the specified directory. If neither
            option is specified, an attempt to read the default
            config directory will be made before trying to use the
            default config file. If a valid config directory exists
            then the default config file is ignored.

−o
          option[=value]

Specify an option with a(n optional)
            value. Possible
            generic options/values are:

              syslog=<subsystems>  (see `−s' in slapd(8))
              syslog−level=<level> (see `−S' in slapd(8))
              syslog−user=<user>   (see `−l' in slapd(8))

Possible options/values specific to slapacl are:

              authzDN
              domain
              peername
              sasl_ssf
              sockname
              sockurl
              ssf
              tls_ssf
              transport_ssf

See the related fields in slapd.access(5)
                for details.

−u

do not fetch the entry from the database. In this
            case, if the entry does not exist, a fake entry with
            the DN given
            with the −b option is
            used, with no attributes. As a consequence, those rules
            that depend on the contents of the target object will
            not behave as with the real object. The DN given with the
            −b option is still
            used to select what rules apply; thus, it must be in
            the naming context of a configured database. See also
            −b.

−U
          authcID

specify an ID to be mapped to a DN as by means of
            authz−regexp or
            authz−rewrite
            rules (see slapd.conf(5) for
            details); mutually exclusive with −D.

−v

enable verbose mode.

−X
          authzID

specify an authorization ID to be mapped to a
            DN as by means
            of authz−regexp or
            authz−rewrite
            rules (see slapd.conf(5) for
            details); mutually exclusive with −o authzDN=DN.

 
EXAMPLES
The command

        SBINDIR/slapacl −f ETCDIR/slapd.conf −v \
            −U bjorn −b "o=University of Michigan,c=US" \
            "o/read:University of Michigan"

tests whether the user bjorn can access the
      attribute o of the entry
      o=University of
      Michigan,c=US at read level.
