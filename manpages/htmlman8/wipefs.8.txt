Name
wipefs — wipe a filesystem signature from a
      device

Synopsis

wipefs [−ahnp] [ −o offset ] device

 
DESCRIPTION
wipefs
      allows to erase filesystem or raid signatures (magic strings)
      from the device to
      make the filesystem invisible for libblkid. wipefs does not erase the
      whole filesystem or any other data from the device. When used
      without options -a or -o, it lists all visible filesystems
      and offsets of their signatures.

 
OPTIONS

−a,
          −−all

Erase all available signatures.

−h,
          −−help

Print help and exit.

−n,
          −−no−act

Causes everything to be done except for the write()
            call.

−o,
          −−offset offset

Specifies location (in bytes) of the signature which
            should be erased from the device. The offset number may
            include a "0x" prefix, and then the number will be read
            as a hex value. It is possible to specify multiple -o
            options.
The offset
            argument may be followed by binary (2^N) suffixes KiB,
            MiB, GiB, TiB, PiB and EiB (the "iB" is optional, e.g.
            "K" has the same meaning as "KiB") or decimal (10^N)
            suffixes KB, MB, GB, PB and EB.

−p,
          −−parsable

Print out in parsable instead of printable format.
            Encode all potentially unsafe characters of a string to
            the corresponding hex value prefixed by '\x'.
