Name
mkfs — build a Linux file system

Synopsis

mkfs [−V] [ −t fstype ] [fs−options]
        filesys [blocks]

 
DESCRIPTION
mkfs is used
      to build a Linux file system on a device, usually a hard disk
      partition. filesys is
      either the device name (e.g. /dev/hda1, /dev/sdb2), or a regular file that shall
      contain the file system. blocks is the number of blocks
      to be used for the file system.
The exit code returned by mkfs is 0 on success and 1
      on failure.
In actuality, mkfs is simply a front-end
      for the various file system builders (mkfs.fstype) available under Linux.
      The file system-specific builder is searched for in a number
      of directories like perhaps /sbin, /sbin/fs, /sbin/fs.d, /etc/fs, /etc
      (the precise list is defined at compile time but at least
      contains /sbin and /sbin/fs), and finally in the directories
      listed in the PATH environment variable. Please see the file
      system-specific builder manual pages for further details.

 
OPTIONS

−V

Produce verbose output, including all file
            system-specific commands that are executed. Specifying
            this option more than once inhibits execution of any
            file system-specific commands. This is really only
            useful for testing.

−tfstype

Specifies the type of file system to be built. If
            not specified, the default file system type (currently
            ext2) is used.

fs-options

File system-specific options to be passed to the
            real file system builder. Although not guaranteed, the
            following options are supported by most file system
            builders.

−c

Check the device for bad blocks before building the
            file system.

−lfilename

Read the bad blocks list from filename

−v

Produce verbose output.

 
BUGS
All generic options must precede and not be combined with
      file system-specific options. Some file system-specific
      programs do not support the −v (verbose) option, nor return
      meaningful exit codes. Also, some file system-specific
      programs do not automatically detect the device size and
      require the blocks
      parameter to be specified.
