Name
uuidd — UUID generation daemon

Synopsis

uuidd [−d] [ −p pidfile ] [ −s socketpath ] [ −T timeout ]

uuidd [ −r | −t ] [ −n number ] [ −s socketpath ]

uuidd \-k

 
DESCRIPTION
The uuidd
      daemon is used by the UUID library to generate universally
      unique identifiers (UUIDs), especially time-based UUIDs, in a
      secure and guaranteed-unique fashion, even in the face of
      large numbers of threads running on different CPUs trying to
      grab UUIDs.

 
OPTIONS

−d

Run uuidd in debugging
            mode. This prevents uuidd from running as a daemon.

−k

If currently a uuidd daemon is running, kill it.

−n
          number

When issuing a test request to a running uuidd,
            request a bulk response of number UUIDs.

−p
          pidfile

Specify the pathname where the pid file should be
            written. By default, the pid file is written to
            /var/run/uuidd/uuidd.pid.

−s
          socketpath

Specify the pathname used for the unix-domain socket
            used by uuidd. By default, the pathname used is
            /var/run/uuidd/request. This is primarily for debugging
            purposes, since the pathname is hard-coded in the
            libuuid library.

−r

Test uuidd by trying to connect to a running uuidd
            daemon and request it to return a random-based
            UUID.

−t

Test uuidd by trying to connect to a running uuidd
            daemon and request it to return a time-based UUID.

−T
          timeout

Specify a timeout for uuidd. If specified, then
            uuidd will exit after timeout seconds of
            inactivity.

−q

Turn on quiet flag.
