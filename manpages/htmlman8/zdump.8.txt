Synopsis

DESCRIPTION
Zdump prints
      the current time in each zonename named on the command

These options are available:

−v

For each zonename on the command
            line, print the time at the lowest possible time value,
            the time one day after the lowest possible time value,
            the times both one second before and exactly at each
            detected time discontinuity, the time at one day less
            than the highest possible time value, and the time at
            the highest possible time value. Each line ends with
            isdst=1 if
            the given time is Daylight Saving Time or isdst=0 otherwise.
