Name
lsblk — list block devices

Synopsis

lsblk [options]

lsblk [options]
        device...

 
DESCRIPTION
lsblk lists
      information about all or the specified block devices. The
      lsblk command
      reads the sysfs
      filesystem to gather information.
The command prints all block devices (except RAM disks) in
      a tree-like format by default. Use lsblk --help to get a list of all
      available columns.

 
OPTIONS

−a,
          −−all

List all block devices.

−b,
          −−bytes

Print the SIZE column in bytes rather than in
            human-readable format.

−d,
          −−nodeps

Don't print device holders or slaves. For example
            "lsblk --nodeps /dev/sda" prints information about the
            sda device only.

−e,
          −−exclude list

Exclude the devices specified by a comma-delimited
            list of major device numbers. Note that RAM disks
            (major=1) are excluded by default.

−f,
          −−fs

Output info about filesystems. This option is
            equivalent to "-o NAME,FSTYPE,LABEL,MOUNTPOINT". The
            authoritative information about filesystems and raids
            is provided by the blkid(8) command.

−h,
          −−help

Print a help text and exit.

−i,
          −−ascii

Use ascii characters for tree formatting.

−m,
          −−perms

Output info about device owner, group and mode. This
            option is equivalent to "-o
            NAME,SIZE,OWNER,GROUP,MODE".

−l,
          −−list

Use the list output format.

−n,
          −−noheadings

Do not print a header line.

−o,
          −−output list

Specify which output columns to print. Use
            −−help to get a
            list of all supported columns.

−r,
          −−raw

Use the raw output format.

−t,
          −−topology

Output info about block device topology. This option
            is equivalent to "-o
            NAME,ALIGNMENT,MIN-IO,OPT-IO,PHY-SEC,LOG-SEC,ROTA,SCHED".
