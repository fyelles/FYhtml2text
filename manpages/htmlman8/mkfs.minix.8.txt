Name
mkfs.minix — make a Linux MINIX filesystem

Synopsis

mkfs.minix [ −c | −l filename ] [ −n namelength ] [ −i inodecount ] [−v] device
        [size−in−blocks]

 
DESCRIPTION
mkfs.minix
      creates a Linux MINIX file-system on a device (usually a disk
      partition).
The device is
      usually of the following form:

        /dev/hda[1-8] (IDE disk 1)
        /dev/hdb[1-8] (IDE disk 2)
        /dev/sda[1-8] (SCSI disk 1)
        /dev/sdb[1-8] (SCSI disk 2)

The size-in-blocks
      parameter is the desired size of the file system, in blocks.
      It is present only for backwards compatibility. If omitted
      the size will be determined automatically. Only block counts
      strictly greater than 10 and strictly less than 65536 are
      allowed.

 
OPTIONS

−c

Check the device for bad blocks before creating the
            file system. If any are found, the count is
            printed.

−n
          namelength

Specify the maximum length of filenames. Currently,
            the only allowable values are 14 and 30. The default is
            30. Note that kernels older than 0.99p7 only accept
            namelength 14.

−i
          inodecount

Specify the number of inodes for the filesystem.

−l
          filename

Read the bad blocks list from filename. The file has
            one bad block number per line. The count of bad blocks
            read is printed.

−v

Make a Minix version 2 filesystem.
