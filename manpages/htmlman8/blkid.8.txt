DESCRIPTION
The blkid
      program is the command-line interface to working with
      libblkid(3) library. It can
      determine the type of content (e.g. filesystem, swap) a block
      device holds, and also attributes (tokens, NAME=value pairs)
      from the content metadata (e.g. LABEL or UUID fields).
blkid has
      two main forms of operation: either searching for a device
      with a specific NAME=value pair, or displaying NAME=value
      pairs for one or more devices.

 
OPTIONS
The size and
      offset arguments may
      be followed by binary (2^N) suffixes KiB, MiB, GiB, TiB, PiB
      and EiB (the "iB" is optional, e.g. "K" has the same meaning
      as "KiB") or decimal (10^N) suffixes KB, MB, GB, PB and
      EB.

−c
          cachefile

Read from cachefile instead of
            reading from the default cache file /etc/blkid.tab. If you want to start
            with a clean cache (i.e. don't report devices
            previously scanned but not necessarily available at
            this time), specify /dev/null.

−g

Perform a garbage collection pass on the blkid cache
            to remove devices which no longer exist.

−h

Display a usage message and exit.

−i

Display I/O Limits (aka I/O topology) information.
            The 'export' output format is automatically enabled.
            This option could be used together with −p option.

−l

Look up one device that matches the search parameter
            specified using the −t option. If there are multiple
            devices that match the specified search parameter, then
            the device with the highest priority is returned,
            and/or the first device found at a given priority.
            Device types in order of decreasing priority are Device
            Mapper, EVMS, LVM, MD, and finally regular block
            devices. If this option is not specified, blkid will print all
            of the devices that match the search parameter.

−L
          label

Look up one device that uses the label (same as: -l
            -o device -t LABEL=<label>). This look up method
            is able to reliable use /dev/disk/by-label udev
            symlinks (depends on setting in /etc/blkid.conf). Avoid
            to use the symlinks directly. It is not reliable to use
            the symlinks without verification. The −L option works on
            systems with and without udev.
Unfortunately, the original blkid(8) from
            e2fsprogs use the −L option as a
            synonym to the −o
            list option. For better portability use "-l -o
            device -t LABEL=<label>" and "-o list" in your
            scripts rather than -L option.

−n
          list

Restrict probing functions to defined (comma
            separated) list of superblock types (names). The list
            can be prefixed with "no" to specify the types which
            should be ignored. For example:

  blkid -p -n vfat,ext3,ext4 /dev/sda1

probes for vfat, ext3 and ext4 filesystems, and

  blkid -p -u nominix /dev/sda1

probes for all supported formats exclude minix
            filesystem. This option is useful with −p only.

−o
          format

Display blkid's output using
            the specified format. The format parameter may
            be:

full

print all tags (the default)

value

print the value of the tags

list

print the devices in a user-friendly
                      format, this output format is unsupported for
                      low-level probing (−p or
                      −i)

device

print the device name only, this output
                      format is always enabled for −L and
                      −U
                      options

udev

print key="value" pairs for easy import
                      into the udev environment. The keys are
                      prefixed by ID_FS_ or ID_PART_ prefixes.
The udev output returns ID_FS_AMBIVALENT
                      tag if more superblocks are detected, and
                      ID_PART_ENTRY_* tags are always returned for
                      all partitions including empty
                      partitions.

export

print key=value pairs for easy import into
                      the environment. This output format is
                      automatically enabled when I/O Limits
                      (−i
                      option) are requested.

−O
          offset

Probe at the given offset (only useful with
            −p). This
            option could be used together with −i option.

−p

Switch to low-level superblock probing mode (bypass
            cache).
Note that low-level probing also returns information
            about partition table type (PTTYPE tag) and partitions
            (PART_ENTRY_* tags).

−s
          tag

For each (specified) device, show only the tags that
            match tag. It
            is possible to specify multiple −s options. If no tag is
            specified, then all tokens are shown for all
            (specified) devices. In order to just refresh the cache
            without showing any tokens, use −s none with no other
            options.

−S
          size

Overwrite device/file size (only useful with
            −p).

−t
          NAME=value

Search for block devices with tokens named
            NAME that have the value
            value,
            and display any devices which are found. Common values
            for NAME include
            TYPE, LABEL, and UUID. If there are no devices
            specified on the command line, all block devices will
            be searched; otherwise only the specified devices are
            searched.

−u
          list

Restrict probing functions to defined (comma
            separated) list of "usage" types. Supported usage types
            are: filesystem, raid, crypto and other. The list can
            be prefixed with "no" to specify the usage types which
            should be ignored. For example:

  blkid -p -u filesystem,other /dev/sda1

probes for all filesystems and others (e.g. swap)
            formats, and

  blkid -p -u noraid /dev/sda1

probes for all supported formats exclude RAIDs. This
            option is useful with −p only.

−U
          uuid

Look up one device that uses the uuid. For more
            details see the −L option.

−v

Display version number and exit.

−w
          writecachefile

Write the device cache to writecachefile
            instead of writing it to the default cache file
            /etc/blkid.tab. If you
            don't want to save the cache to the default file,
            specify /dev/null. If not
            specified it will be the same file as that given by the
            −c option.

device

Display tokens from only the specified device. It is
            possible to give multiple device options on the
            command line. If none is given, all devices which
            appear in /proc/partitions are shown, if they
            are recognized.

 
RETURN CODE
If the specified token was found, or if any tags were
      shown from (specified) devices, 0 is returned.
If the specified token was not found, or no (specified)
      devices could be identified an exit code of 2 is
      returned.
For usage or other errors, an exit code of 4 is
      returned.
If the ambivalent low-level probing result was detected an
      exit code of 8 is returned.
