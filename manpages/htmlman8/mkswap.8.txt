Name
mkswap — set up a Linux swap area

Synopsis

mkswap [−c] [−f] [ −p PSZ ] [ −L label ] [ −U uuid ] device [size]

 
DESCRIPTION
mkswap sets
      up a Linux swap area on a device or in a file.
The device
      argument will usually be a disk partition (something like
      /dev/sdb7) but can also be a
      file. The Linux kernel does not look at partition IDs, but
      many installation scripts will assume that partitions of hex
      type 82 (LINUX_SWAP) are meant to be swap partitions.
      (Warning: Solaris also uses this
      type. Be careful not to killyour Solaris
      partitions.)
The size parameter
      is superfluous but retained for backwards compatibility. (It
      specifies the desired size of the swap area in 1024-byte
      blocks. mkswap
      will use the entire partition or file if it is omitted.
      Specifying it is unwise -- a typo may destroy your disk.)
The PSZ parameter
      specifies the page size to use. It is almost always
      unnecessary (even unwise) to specify it, but certain old libc
      versions lie about the page size, so it is possible that
      mkswap gets it
      wrong. The symptom is that a subsequent swapon fails because no
      swap signature is found. Typical values for PSZ are 4096 or 8192.
After creating the swap area, you need the swapon command to start
      using it. Usually swap areas are listed in /etc/fstab so that they can be taken into
      use at boot time by a swapon
      -a command in some boot script.

 
WARNING
The swap header does not touch the first block. A boot
      loader or disk label can be there, but it is not a
      recommended setup. The recommended setup is to use a separate
      partition for a Linux swap area.
mkswap, like many others
      mkfs-like utils, erases the first block to remove
old on-disk
      filesystems.
mkswap
      refuses to erase the first block on a device with a disk
      label (SUN, BSD, ...) or on a whole disk (e.g. /dev/sda).

 
OPTIONS

−c

Check the device (if it is a block device) for bad
            blocks before creating the swap area. If any are found,
            the count is printed.

−f

Force -- go ahead even if the command is stupid.
            This allows the creation of a swap area larger than the
            file or partition it resides on.
Without this option, mkswap will refuse to
            erase the first block on a device with a partition
            table or on a whole disk (e.g. /dev/sda).

−L
          label

Specify a label, to allow swapon by label.

−p
          PSZ

Specify the page size (in bytes) to use. This option
            is usually unnecessary, mkswap reads the size
            from the kernel.

−U
          uuid

Specify the uuid to use. The default is to generate
            a UUID.

−v1

Specify the swap-space version. The old −v0
            option has become obsolete and now only −v1 is
            supported.
The kernel has not supported v0 swap-space format
            since 2.5.22. The new version v1 is supported since
            2.1.117.

 
NOTES
The maximum useful size of a swap area depends on the
      architecture and the kernel version. It is roughly 2GiB on
      i386, PPC, m68k and ARM, 1GiB on sparc, 512MiB on mips,
      128GiB on alpha, and 3TiB on sparc64. For kernels after 2.3.3
      there is no such limitation.
Note that before version 2.1.117 the kernel allocated one
      byte for each page, while it now allocates two bytes, so that
      taking into use a swap area of 2 GiB might require 2 MiB of
      kernel memory.
Presently, Linux allows 32 swap areas (this was 8 before
      Linux 2.4.10). The areas in use can be seen in the file
      /proc/swaps (since 2.1.25).
mkswap
      refuses areas smaller than 10 pages.
If you don't know the page size that your machine uses,
      you may be able to look it up with "cat /proc/cpuinfo" (or
      you may not -- the contents of this file depend on
      architecture and kernel version).
To set up a swap file, it is necessary to create that file
      before initializing it with mkswap, e.g. using a
      command like

        # dd if=/dev/zero of=swapfile bs=1024 count=65536

Note that a swap file must not contain any holes (so,
      using cp(1) to create the file is
      not acceptable).
