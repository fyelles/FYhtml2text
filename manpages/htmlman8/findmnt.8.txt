Name
findmnt — find a filesystem

Synopsis

findmnt [options]

findmnt [options] device |
        mountpoint

findmnt [options]
        [−−source] device
        [−−target]
        mountpoint

 
DESCRIPTION
findmnt will
      list all mounted filesytems or search for a filesystem. The
      findmnt command
      is able to search in /etc/fstab, /etc/fstab.d, /etc/mtab or /proc/self/mountinfo. If device or mountpoint is not given, all
      filesystems are shown.
The command prints all mounted filesystems in the
      tree-like format by default.

 
OPTIONS

−h,
          −−help

Print help and exit.

−s,
          −−fstab

Search in /etc/fstab
            and /etc/fstab.d. The
            output is in the list format (see --list).

−m,
          −−mtab

Search in /etc/mtab.
            The output is in the list format (see --list).

−k,
          −−kernel

Search in /proc/self/mountinfo. The output is
            in the tree-like format. This is the default.

−c,
          −−canonicalize

Canonicalize all printed paths.

−d,
          −−direction word

The search direction - forward or
            backward.

−e,
          −−evaluate

Convert all tags (LABEL or UUID) to the device
            names.

−f,
          −−first−only

Print the first matching filesystem only.

−i,
          −−invert

Invert the sense of matching.

−l,
          −−list

Use the list output format. This output format is
            automatically enabled if the output is restricted by
            −t, −O, −S or −T option and the option
            −−submounts is
            not used.

−v,
          −−nofsroot

Do not print a [/dir] in the SOURCE column for
            bind-mounts or btrfs subvolumes.

−n,
          −−noheadings

Do not print a header line.

−u,
          −−notruncate

Do not truncate text in columns. The default is to
            not truncate the TARGET,
            SOURCE, UUID and LABEL columns. This option disables
            text truncation also in all other columns.

−O,
          −−options list

Used to limit the set of printed filesystems. More
            than one option may be specified in a comma-separated
            list. The −t and
            −O options are
            cumulative in effect. It is different from −t in that each option is matched
            exactly; a leading no at the beginning
            of one option does not negate the rest. For more
            details see mount(8).

−o,
          −−output list

Define output columns. Currently supported are
            SOURCE, TARGET, FSTYPE, OPTIONS, VFS-OPTIONS, FS-OPTIONS,
            LABEL and UUID. The TARGET column contains tree
            formatting if the −−list or −−raw options are not
            specified.

−r,
          −−raw

Use raw output format.

−a,
          −−ascii

Use ascii characters for tree formatting.

−t,
          −−types list

Used to limit the set of printed filesystems. More
            than one type may be specified in a comma-separated
            list. The list of filesystem types can be prefixed with
            no to
            specify the filesystem types on which no action should
            be taken. For more details see mount(8).

−R,
          −−submounts

Print recursively all submounts for the selected
            filesystems. The restrictions defined by options
            −t, −O, −S, −T and −−direction are not applied
            to submounts. All submounts are always printed in
            tree-like order. The option enables the tree-like
            output format by default. This option has no effect for
            −−mtab or
            −−fstab.

−S,
          −−source spec

Explicitly define the mount source. Supported are
            device, LABEL= or UUID=.

−T,
          −−target dir

Explicitly define the mount target (mountpoint
            directory).

 
EXAMPLES

findmnt
          −−fstab −t nfs

Prints all nfs filesystems defined in /etc/fstab.

findmnt
          −−fstab /mnt/foo

Prints all /etc/fstab
            filesystems where the mountpoint directory is /mnt/foo.
            It also prints bind mounts where /mnt/foo is a
            source.

findmnt
          −−fstab --target
          /mnt/foo

Prints all /etc/fstab
            filesystems where the mountpoint directory is
            /mnt/foo.

findmnt
          --fstab --evaluate

Prints all /etc/fstab
            filesystems and converts LABEL= and UUID= tags to the
            real device names.

findmnt
          -n --raw --evaluate --output=target
          LABEL=/boot

Prints only the mountpoint where the filesystem with
            label "/boot" is mounted.
