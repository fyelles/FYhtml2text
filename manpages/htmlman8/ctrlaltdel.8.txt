Name
ctrlaltdel — set the function of the Ctrl-Alt-Del
      combination

Synopsis

ctrlaltdel hard | soft

 
DESCRIPTION
Based on examination of the linux/kernel/sys.c code, it is clear that
      there are two supported functions that the Ctrl-Alt-Del
      sequence can perform: a hard reset, which immediately
      reboots the computer without calling sync(2) and without any
      other preparation; and a soft reset, which sends the
      SIGINT (interrupt) signal to the init process (this is
      always the process with PID 1). If this option is used, the
      init(8) program must support
      this feature. Since there are now several init(8) programs in the Linux
      community, please consult the documentation for the version
      that you are currently using.
ctrlaltdel
      is usually used in the /etc/rc.local file.
