Name
isosize — outputs the length of an iso9660 file
      system

Synopsis

isosize [−x] [ −d <num> ]
        <iso9660_image_file>...

 
DESCRIPTION
This command outputs the length of an iso9660 file system
      that is contained in given file. That file may be a normal
      file or a block device (e.g. /dev/hdd or /dev/sr0). In the
      absence of any switches (or errors) it will output the size
      of the iso9660 file system in bytes. This can now be a large
      number (>> 4 GB).

−x

output in humanly readable form the block count and
            the block size. Output uses the term "sectors" for
            "blocks".

−d
          <num>

only has affect when −x is not given. The number
            output (if no errors) is the iso9660 file size in bytes
            divided by <num>. So if
            <num> is
            the block size then the output number will be the block
            count.

The size of the file (or block device) holding a iso9660
      file system can be marginally larger than the actual size of
      the iso9660 file system. One reason for this is that cd
      writers are allowed to add "run out" sectors at the end of a
      iso9660 image.
