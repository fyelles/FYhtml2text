Name
fifo — first-in first-out special file, named
      pipe

 
DESCRIPTION
A FIFO special file (a named pipe) is similar to a pipe,
      except that it is accessed as part of the file system. It can
      be opened by multiple processes for reading or writing. When
      processes are exchanging data via the FIFO, the kernel passes
      all data internally without writing it to the file system.
      Thus, the FIFO special file has no contents on the file
      system; the file system entry merely serves as a reference
      point so that processes can access the pipe using a name in
      the file system.
The kernel maintains exactly one pipe object for each FIFO
      special file that is opened by at least one process. The FIFO
      must be opened on both ends (reading and writing) before data
      can be passed. Normally, opening the FIFO blocks until the
      other end is opened also.
A process can open a FIFO in nonblocking mode. In this
      case, opening for read only will succeed even if no-one has
      opened on the write side yet, opening for write only will
      fail with ENXIO (no such
      device or address) unless the other end has already been
      opened.
Under Linux, opening a FIFO for read and write will
      succeed both in blocking and nonblocking mode. POSIX leaves
      this behavior undefined. This can be used to open a FIFO for
      writing while there are no readers available. A process that
      uses both ends of the connection in order to communicate with
      itself should be very careful to avoid deadlocks.

 
NOTES
When a process tries to write to a FIFO that is not opened
      for read on the other side, the process is sent a
      SIGPIPE signal.
FIFO special files can be created by mkfifo(3), and are
      indicated by ls
      −l with the file type 'p'.
