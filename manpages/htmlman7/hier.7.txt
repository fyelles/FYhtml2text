hier — Description of the file system hierarchy

 
DESCRIPTION
A typical Linux system has, among others, the following
      directories:

/

This is the root directory. This is where the whole
            tree starts.

/bin

This directory contains executable programs which
            are needed in single user mode and to bring the system
            up or repair it.

/boot

Contains static files for the boot loader. This
            directory only holds the files which are needed during
            the boot process. The map installer and configuration
            files should go to /sbin
            and /etc.

/dev

Special or device files, which refer to physical
            devices. See mknod(1).

/etc

Contains configuration files which are local to the
            machine. Some larger software packages, like X11, can
            have their own subdirectories below /etc. Site-wide configuration files
            may be placed here or in /usr/etc. Nevertheless, programs
            should always look for these files in /etc and you may have links for these
            files to /usr/etc.

/etc/opt

Host-specific configuration files for add-on
            applications installed in /opt.

/etc/sgml

This directory contains the configuration files for
            SGML and XML (optional).

/etc/skel

When a new user account is created, files from this
            directory are usually copied into the user's home
            directory.

/etc/X11

Configuration files for the X11 window system
            (optional).

/home

On machines with home directories for users, these
            are usually beneath this directory, directly or not.
            The structure of this directory depends on local
            administration decisions.

/lib

This directory should hold those shared libraries
            that are necessary to boot the system and to run the
            commands in the root file system.

/media

This directory contains mount points for removable
            media such as CD and DVD disks or USB sticks.

/mnt

This directory is a mount point for a temporarily
            mounted file system. In some distributions,
            /mnt contains
            subdirectories intended to be used as mount points for
            several temporary file systems.

/opt

This directory should contain add-on packages that
            contain static files.

/proc

This is a mount point for the proc file system, which
            provides information about running processes and the
            kernel. This pseudo-file system is described in more
            detail in proc(5).

/root

This directory is usually the home directory for the
            root user (optional).

/sbin

Like /bin, this
            directory holds commands needed to boot the system, but
            which are usually not executed by normal users.

/srv

This directory contains site-specific data that is
            served by this system.

/tmp

This directory contains temporary files which may be
            deleted with no notice, such as by a regular job or at
            system boot up.

/usr

This directory is usually mounted from a separate
            partition. It should hold only sharable, read-only
            data, so that it can be mounted by various machines
            running Linux.

/usr/X11R6

The X−Window system, version 11 release 6
            (optional).

/usr/X11R6/bin

Binaries which belong to the X−Window system;
            often, there is a symbolic link from the more
            traditional /usr/bin/X11
            to here.

/usr/X11R6/lib

Data files associated with the X−Window
            system.

/usr/X11R6/lib/X11

These contain miscellaneous files needed to run X;
            Often, there is a symbolic link from /usr/lib/X11 to this directory.

/usr/X11R6/include/X11

Contains include files needed for compiling programs
            using the X11 window system. Often, there is a symbolic
            link from /usr/include/X11 to this
            directory.

/usr/bin

This is the primary directory for executable
            programs. Most programs executed by normal users which
            are not needed for booting or for repairing the system
            and which are not installed locally should be placed in
            this directory.

/usr/bin/X11

is the traditional place to look for X11
            executables; on Linux, it usually is a symbolic link to
            /usr/X11R6/bin.

/usr/dict

Replaced by /usr/share/dict.

/usr/doc

Replaced by /usr/share/doc.

/usr/etc

Site-wide configuration files to be shared between
            several machines may be stored in this directory.
            However, commands should always reference those files
            using the /etc directory.
            Links from files in /etc
            should point to the appropriate files in /usr/etc.

/usr/games

Binaries for games and educational programs
            (optional).

/usr/include

Include files for the C compiler.

/usr/include/X11

Include files for the C compiler and the
            X−Window system. This is usually a symbolic link
            to /usr/X11R6/include/X11.

/usr/include/asm

Include files which declare some assembler
            functions. This used to be a symbolic link to
            /usr/src/linux/include/asm.

/usr/include/linux

This contains information which may change from
            system release to system release and used to be a
            symbolic link to /usr/src/linux/include/linux to get
            at operating system specific information.
(Note that one should have include files there that
            work correctly with the current libc and in user space.
            However, Linux kernel source is not designed to be used
            with user programs and does not know anything about the
            libc you are using. It is very likely that things will
            break if you let /usr/include/asm and /usr/include/linux point at a random
            kernel tree. Debian systems don't do this and use
            headers from a known good kernel version, provided in
            the libc*-dev package.)

/usr/include/g++

Include files to use with the GNU C++ compiler.

/usr/lib

Object libraries, including dynamic libraries, plus
            some executables which usually are not invoked
            directly. More complicated programs may have whole
            subdirectories there.

/usr/lib/X11

The usual place for data files associated with X
            programs, and configuration files for the X system
            itself. On Linux, it usually is a symbolic link to
            /usr/X11R6/lib/X11.

/usr/lib/gcc-lib

contains executables and include files for the GNU C
            compiler, gcc(1).

/usr/lib/groff

Files for the GNU groff document formatting
            system.

/usr/lib/uucp

Files for uucp(1).

/usr/local

This is where programs which are local to the site
            typically go.

/usr/local/bin

Binaries for programs local to the site.

/usr/local/doc

Local documentation.

/usr/local/etc

Configuration files associated with locally
            installed programs.

/usr/local/games

Binaries for locally installed games.

/usr/local/lib

            programs.

/usr/local/man

Man pages associated with locally installed
            programs.

/usr/local/sbin

Locally installed programs for system
            administration.

/usr/local/share

Local application data that can be shared among
            different architectures of the same OS.

/usr/local/src

Source code for locally installed software.

/usr/man

Replaced by /usr/share/man.

/usr/sbin

This directory contains program binaries for system
            administration which are not essential for the boot
            process, for mounting /usr, or for system repair.

/usr/share

This directory contains subdirectories with specific
            application data, that can be shared among different
            architectures of the same OS. Often one finds stuff
            here that used to live in /usr/doc or /usr/lib or /usr/man.

/usr/share/dict

Contains the word lists used by spell checkers.

/usr/share/doc

Documentation about installed programs.

/usr/share/games

Static data files for games in /usr/games.

/usr/share/info

Info pages go here.

/usr/share/locale

Locale information goes here.

/usr/share/man

Manual pages go here in subdirectories according to
            the man page sections.

/usr/share/man/<locale>/man[1−9]

These directories contain manual pages for the
            specific locale in source code form. Systems which use
            a unique language and code set for all manual pages may
            omit the <locale> substring.

/usr/share/misc

Miscellaneous data that can be shared among
            different architectures of the same OS.

/usr/share/nls

The message catalogs for native language support go
            here.

/usr/share/sgml

Files for SGML and XML.

/usr/share/terminfo

The database for terminfo.

/usr/share/tmac

Troff macros that are not distributed with
            groff.

/usr/share/zoneinfo

Files for timezone information.

/usr/src

Source files for different parts of the system,
            included with some packages for reference purposes.
            Don't work here with your own projects, as files below
            /usr should be read-only except when installing
            software.

/usr/src/linux

This was the traditional place for the kernel
            source. Some distributions put here the source for the
            default kernel they ship. You should probably use
            another directory when building your own kernel.

/usr/tmp

Obsolete. This should be a link to /var/tmp. This link is present only
            for compatibility reasons and shouldn't be used.

/var

This directory contains files which may change in
            size, such as spool and log files.

/var/adm

This directory is superseded by /var/log and should be a symbolic
            link to /var/log.

/var/backups

Reserved for historical reasons.

/var/cache

Data cached for programs.

/var/catman/cat[1−9] or
          /var/cache/man/cat[1−9]

These directories contain preformatted manual pages
            according to their man page section. (The use of
            preformatted manual pages is deprecated.)

/var/cron

Reserved for historical reasons.

/var/lib

Variable state information for programs.

/var/local

Variable data for /usr/local.

/var/lock

Lock files are placed in this directory. The naming
            convention for device lock files is LCK..<device>
            where <device> is the
            device's name in the file system. The format used is
            that of HDU UUCP lock files, that is, lock files
            contain a PID as a 10-byte ASCII decimal number,
            followed by a newline character.

/var/log

Miscellaneous log files.

/var/opt

Variable data for /opt.

/var/mail

Users' mailboxes. Replaces /var/spool/mail.

/var/msgs

Reserved for historical reasons.

/var/preserve

Reserved for historical reasons.

/var/run

Run-time variable files, like files holding process
            identifiers (PIDs) and logged user information
            (utmp). Files
            in this directory are usually cleared when the system
            boots.

/var/spool

Spooled (or queued) files for various programs.

/var/spool/at

Spooled jobs for at(1).

/var/spool/cron

Spool directory for news.

/var/spool/rwho

Spooled files for rwhod(8).

/var/spool/smail

Spooled files for the smail(1) mail delivery
            program.

/var/spool/uucp

Spooled files for uucp(1).

/var/tmp

Like /tmp, this
            directory holds temporary files stored for an
            unspecified duration.

/var/yp

Database files for NIS.
