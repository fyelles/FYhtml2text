Name
set_thread_area — Set a Thread Local Storage (TLS)
      area

Synopsis

#include <linux/unistd.h>
#include <asm/ldt.h>

int
            set_thread_area(
struct user_desc *u_info);

           
        

 
DESCRIPTION
set_thread_area() sets an
      entry in the current thread's Thread Local Storage (TLS)
      array. The TLS array entry set by set_thread_area() corresponds to the value
      of u_info−>entry_number
      passed in by the user. If this value is in bounds,
      set_thread_area() copies the
      TLS descriptor pointed to by u_info into the thread's TLS
      array.
When set_thread_area() is
      passed an entry_number of −1, it
      uses a free TLS entry. If set_thread_area() finds a free TLS entry,
      the value of u_info−>entry_number
      is set upon return to show which entry was changed.

 
RETURN VALUE
set_thread_area() returns 0
      on success, and −1 on failure, with errno set appropriately.

 
ERRORS

EINVAL

u_info−>entry_number
            is out of bounds.

EFAULT

u_info is an
            invalid pointer.

ESRCH

A free TLS entry could not be located.

 
VERSIONS
A version of set_thread_area() first appeared in Linux
      2.5.29.

 
CONFORMING TO
set_thread_area() is
      Linux-specific and should not be used in programs that are
      intended to be portable.

 
NOTES
Glibc does not provide a wrapper for this system call;
      call it using syscall(2).
