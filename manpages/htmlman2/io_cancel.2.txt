Name
io_cancel — cancel an outstanding asynchronous I/O
      operation

Synopsis

#include <libaio.h>

int
            io_cancel(
aio_context_t ctx_id,

 
struct iocb *iocb,

 
struct io_event *result);

DESCRIPTION
io_cancel() attempts to
      cancel an asynchronous I/O operation previously submitted
      with io_submit(2). ctx_id is the AIO context ID of
      the operation to be canceled. If the AIO context is found,
      the event will be canceled and then copied into the memory
      pointed to by result
      without being placed into the completion queue.

 
RETURN VALUE
On success, io_cancel()
      returns 0. For the failure return, see NOTES.

 
ERRORS

EAGAIN

The iocb
            specified was not canceled.

EFAULT

One of the data structures points to invalid
            data.

EINVAL

The AIO context specified by ctx_id is invalid.

ENOSYS

io_cancel() is not
            implemented on this architecture.

 
VERSIONS
The asynchronous I/O system calls first appeared in Linux
      2.5, August 2002.

 
CONFORMING TO
io_cancel() is
      Linux-specific and should not be used in programs that are
      intended to be portable.

 
NOTES
Glibc does not provide a wrapper function for this system
      call.
The wrapper provided in libaio for io_cancel() does not follow the usual C
      library conventions for indicating error: on error it returns
      a negated error number (the negative of one of the values
      listed in ERRORS). If the system call is invoked via
      syscall(2), then the return
      value follows the usual conventions for indicating an error:
      −1, with errno set to a
      (positive) value that indicates the error.
