Name
truncate — shrink or extend the size of a file to
      the specified size

Synopsis

truncate OPTION... FILE...

 
DESCRIPTION
Shrink or extend the size of each FILE to the specified
      size
A FILE argument that does not exist is created.
If a FILE is larger than the specified size, the extra
      data is lost. If a FILE is shorter, it is extended and the
      extended part (hole) reads as zero bytes.
Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for
      short options too.

−c, −−no−create

do not create any files

−o, −−io−blocks

treat SIZE as number of IO blocks instead of
            bytes

−r, −−reference=RFILE

base size on RFILE

−s, −−size=SIZE

set or adjust the file size by SIZE

−−help

display this help and exit

−−version

output version information and exit

SIZE may be (or may be an integer optionally followed by)
      one of following: KB 1000, K 1024, MB 1000*1000, M 1024*1024,
      and so on for G, T, P, E, Z, Y.
SIZE may also be prefixed by one of the following
      modifying characters: `+' extend by, `−' reduce by,
      `<' at most, `>' at least, `/' round down to multiple
      of, `%' round up to multiple of.
