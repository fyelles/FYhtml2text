Name
gnutls−serv — GnuTLS test server

 
DESCRIPTION
Simple server program that listens to incoming TLS
      connections.

 
OPTIONS

 
Program control options

−d,
            −−debug LEVEL

Specify the debug level. Default is 1.

−h,
            −−help

prints this help

−l,
            −−list

Print a list of the supported algorithms and
              modes.

−q,
            −−quiet

Suppress some messages.

−v,
            −−version

prints the program's version number

 
Server options

−p,
            −−port integer

The port to listen on.

−−nodb

Does not use the resume database.

−−http

Act as an HTTP Server.

−−echo

Act as an Echo Server.

 
TLS/SSL control options

−−priority PRIORITY
            STRING

TLS algorithms and protocols to enable. You can
              use predefined sets of ciphersuites such as:

PERFORMANCE

all the "secure" ciphersuites are enabled, limited
              to 128 bit ciphers and sorted by terms of speed
              performance.

NORMAL

option enables all "secure" ciphersuites. The
              256-bit ciphers are included as a fallback only. The
              ciphers are sorted by security margin.

SECURE128

flag enables all "secure" ciphersuites with
              ciphers up to 128 bits, sorted by security
              margin.

SECURE256

flag enables all "secure" ciphersuites including
              the 256 bit ciphers, sorted by security margin.

EXPORT

all the ciphersuites are enabled, including the
              low-security 40 bit ciphers.

NONE

nothing is enabled. This disables even protocols
              and compression methods.
Check the GnuTLS manual on section "Priority
              strings" for more information on allowed
              keywords.
Examples:
"NORMAL"

              "NONE:+VERS-TLS-ALL:+MAC-ALL:+RSA:+AES-128-CBC:+SIGN-ALL:+COMP-NULL"
"NORMAL:-ARCFOUR-128" means normal ciphers except
              for ARCFOUR-128.
"SECURE:-VERS-SSL3.0:+COMP-DEFLATE" means that
              only secure ciphers are enabled, SSL3.0 is disabled,
              and libz compression enabled.

              "NONE:+VERS-TLS-ALL:+AES-128-CBC:+RSA:+SHA1:+COMP-NULL:+SIGN-RSA-SHA1"
"NORMAL:%COMPAT" is the most compatible mode

−g,
            −−generate

Generate Diffie-Hellman Parameters.

−−kx kx1
            kx2...

Key exchange methods to enable (use gnutls−cli
              −−list to show the supported
              key exchange methods).

−p,
            −−port integer

The port to connect to.

 
Certificate options

−−pgpcertfile FILE

PGP Public Key (certificate) file to use.

−−pgpkeyfile FILE

PGP Key file to use.

−−pgpkeyring FILE

PGP Key ring file to use.

−−pgptrustdb FILE

PGP trustdb file to use.

−−srppasswd FILE

SRP password file to use.

−−srppasswdconf FILE

SRP password configuration file to use.

−−x509cafile FILE

Certificate file to use.

−−x509certfile FILE

−−x509fmtder

Use DER format for certificates

−−x509keyfile FILE

X.509 key file to use.
