Name
gnutls−cli−debug — GnuTLS test client,
      with verbose output

 
DESCRIPTION
Simple client program to set up a TLS connection to some
      other computer. Like gnutls-cli(1), it sets up a
      TLS connection and forwards data from the standard input to

      is printed to standard error.
