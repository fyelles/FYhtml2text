Name
sha224sum — compute and check SHA224 message
      digest

Synopsis

sha224sum [OPTION...] [FILE...]

 
DESCRIPTION
Print or check SHA224 (224−bit) checksums. With no
      FILE, or when FILE is −, read standard input.

−b, −−binary

read in binary mode

−c, −−check

read SHA224 sums from the FILEs and check them

−t, −−text

read in text mode (default)

 
The following three options are useful only when
        verifying checksums:

−−quiet

don't print OK for each successfully verified
              file

−−status

don't output anything, status code shows
              success

−w, −−warn

warn about improperly formatted checksum lines

−−strict

with −−check, exit
              non−zero for any invalid input

−−help

display this help and exit

−−version

output version information and exit

The sums are computed as described in RFC 3874. When
        checking, the input should be a former output of this
        program. The default mode is to print a line with checksum,
        a character indicating type (`*' for binary, ` ' for text),
        and name for each FILE.
