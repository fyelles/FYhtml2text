Name
mktemp — create a temporary file or directory

Synopsis

mktemp [OPTION...] [TEMPLATE]

 
DESCRIPTION
Create a temporary file or directory, safely, and print
      its name. TEMPLATE must contain at least 3 consecutive `X's
      in last component. If TEMPLATE is not specified, use
      tmp.XXXXXXXXXX, and −−tmpdir is implied. Files are
      created u+rw, and directories u+rwx, minus umask
      restrictions.

−d, −−directory

create a directory, not a file

−u, −−dry−run

do not create anything; merely print a name
            (unsafe)

−q, −−quiet

suppress diagnostics about file/dir−creation
            failure

−−suffix=SUFF

append SUFF to TEMPLATE. SUFF must not contain
            slash. This option is implied if TEMPLATE does not end
            in X.

−−tmpdir[=DIR]

interpret TEMPLATE relative to DIR. If DIR is not
            specified, use $TMPDIR if set, else /tmp. With this
            option, TEMPLATE must not be an absolute name. Unlike
            with −t, TEMPLATE may
            contain slashes, but mktemp creates only the final
            component

−p DIR

use DIR as a prefix; implies −t [deprecated]

−t

interpret TEMPLATE as a single file name component,
            relative to a directory: $TMPDIR, if set; else the
            directory specified via −p; else /tmp [deprecated]

−−help

display this help and exit

−−version

output version information and exit
