Name
base64 — base64 encode/decode data and print to
      standard output

Synopsis

base64 [OPTION...] [FILE]

 
DESCRIPTION
Base64 encode or decode FILE, or standard input, to
      standard output.

−d, −−decode

decode data

−i, −−ignore−garbage

when decoding, ignore non−alphabet
            characters

−w, −−wrap=COLS

wrap encoded lines after COLS character (default
            76). Use 0 to disable line wrapping

−−help

display this help and exit

−−version

output version information and exit

With no FILE, or when FILE is −, read standard
      input.
The data are encoded as described for the base64 alphabet
      in RFC 3548. When decoding, the input may contain newlines in
      addition to the bytes of the formal base64 alphabet. Use
      −−ignore−garbage to attempt
      to recover from any other non−alphabet bytes in the
      encoded stream.
