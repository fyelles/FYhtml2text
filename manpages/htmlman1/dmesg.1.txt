Name
dmesg — print or control the kernel ring buffer

Synopsis

dmesg [−c] [−r] [ −n level ] [ −s bufsize ]

 
DESCRIPTION
dmesg is
      used to examine or control the kernel ring buffer.
The program helps users to print out their bootup
      messages. Instead of copying the messages by hand, the user
      need only:

dmesg > boot.messages

and mail the boot.messages file to whoever
      can debug their problem.

 
OPTIONS

−c

Clear the ring buffer contents after printing.

−r

Print the raw message buffer, i.e., don't strip the
            log level prefixes.

−s
          bufsize

Use a buffer of size bufsize to query the
            kernel ring buffer. This is 16392 by default. (The
            default kernel syslog buffer size was 4096 at first,
            8192 since 1.3.54, 16384 since 2.1.113.) If you have
            set the kernel buffer to be larger than the default
            then this option can be used to view the entire
            buffer.

−n
          level

Set the level at which logging of
            messages is done to the console. For example,
            −n 1 prevents all
            messages, except panic messages, from appearing on the
            console. All levels of messages are still written to
            /proc/kmsg, so
            syslogd(8) can still be
            used to control exactly where kernel messages appear.
            When the −n option is
            used, dmesg will not print
            or clear the kernel ring buffer.
When both options are used, only the last option on
            the command line will have an effect.
