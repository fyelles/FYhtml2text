Name
mcookie — generate magic cookies for xauth

Synopsis

mcookie [−v] [ −f filename ]

 
DESCRIPTION
mcookie
      generates a 128-bit random hexadecimal number for use with
      the X authority system. Typical usage:

xauth add :0 . `mcookie`

The "random" number generated is actually the output of
      the MD5 message digest fed with various pieces of random
      information: the current time, the process id, the parent
      process id, the contents of an input file (if −f is specified), and several bytes of
      information from the first of the following devices which is
      present: /dev/random,
      /dev/urandom, files in
      /proc, /dev/audio.

 
BUGS
The entropy in the generated 128-bit is probably quite
      small (and, therefore, vulnerable to attack) unless a
      non-pseudorandom number generator is used (e.g., /dev/random under Linux).
It is assumed that none of the devices opened will
      block.
