Name
gnutls−cli — GnuTLS test client

 
DESCRIPTION
Simple client program to set up a TLS connection to some
      other computer. It sets up a TLS connection and forwards data
      from the standard input to the secured socket and vice
      versa.

 
OPTIONS

 
Program control options

−d,
            −−debug LEVEL

Specify the debug level. Default is 1.

−h,
            −−help

Prints a short reminder of the command line
              options.

−l,
            −−list

Print a list of the supported algorithms and
              modes.

−r,
            −−resume

Connect, establish a session. Connect again and
              resume this session.

−s,
            −−starttls

Connect, establish a plain session and start TLS
              when EOF or a SIGALRM is received.

−v,
            −−version

Prints the program's version number.

−V,
            −−verbose

More verbose output.

 
TLS/SSL control options

−−priority PRIORITY
            STRING

TLS algorithms and protocols to enable. You can
              use predefined sets of ciphersuites such as:

PERFORMANCE

all the "secure" ciphersuites are enabled, limited
              to 128 bit ciphers and sorted by terms of speed
              performance.

NORMAL

option enables all "secure" ciphersuites. The
              256-bit ciphers are included as a fallback only. The
              ciphers are sorted by security margin.

SECURE128

flag enables all "secure" ciphersuites with
              ciphers up to 128 bits, sorted by security
              margin.

SECURE256

flag enables all "secure" ciphersuites including
              the 256 bit ciphers, sorted by security margin.

EXPORT

all the ciphersuites are enabled, including the
              low-security 40 bit ciphers.

NONE

nothing is enabled. This disables even protocols
              and compression methods.
Check the GnuTLS manual on section "Priority
              strings" for more information on allowed
              keywords.
Examples:
"NORMAL"

              "NONE:+VERS-TLS-ALL:+MAC-ALL:+RSA:+AES-128-CBC:+SIGN-ALL:+COMP-NULL"
"NORMAL:-ARCFOUR-128" means normal ciphers except
              for ARCFOUR-128.
"SECURE:-VERS-SSL3.0:+COMP-DEFLATE" means that
              only secure ciphers are enabled, SSL3.0 is disabled,
              and libz compression enabled.

              "NONE:+VERS-TLS-ALL:+AES-128-CBC:+RSA:+SHA1:+COMP-NULL:+SIGN-RSA-SHA1"
"NORMAL:%COMPAT" is the most compatible mode

−−crlf

Send CR LF instead of LF.

−f,
            −−fingerprint

Send the openpgp fingerprint, instead of the
              key.

−p,
            −−port integer

The port to connect to.
