Name
ddate — converts Gregorian dates to Discordian
      dates

Synopsis

ddate [+format] [date]

 
DESCRIPTION
ddate prints
      the date in Discordian date format.
If called with no arguments, ddate will get the current
      system date, convert this to the Discordian date format and
      print this on the standard output. Alternatively, a Gregorian
      date may be specified on the command line, in the form of a
      numerical day, month and year.
If a format string is specified, the Discordian date will
      be printed in a format specified by the string. This
      mechanism works similarly to the format string mechanism of
      date(1), only
      almost completely differently. The fields are:

%A

Full name of the day of the week (i.e.,
            Sweetmorn)

%a

Abbreviated name of the day of the week (i.e.,
            SM)

%B

Full name of the season (i.e., Chaos)

%b

Abbreviated name of the season (i.e., Chs)

%d

Ordinal number of day in season (i.e., 23)

%e

Cardinal number of day in season (i.e., 23rd)

%H

Name of current Holyday, if any

%N

Magic code to prevent rest of format from being
            printed unless today is a Holyday.

%n

Newline

%t

Tab

%X

Number of days remaining until X-Day. (Not valid if
            the SubGenius options are not compiled in.)

%{
%}

Used to enclose the part of the string which is to
            be replaced with the words "St. Tib's Day" if the
            current day is St. Tib's Day.

%.

EXAMPLES

% ddate
Sweetmorn, Bureaucracy 42, 3161 YOLD

% ddate +'Today is %{%A, the %e of %B%}, %Y. %N%nCelebrate %H'
Today is Sweetmorn, the 42nd of Bureaucracy, 3161.

% ddate +"It's %{%A, the %e of %B%}, %Y. %N%nCelebrate %H" 26 9 1995
It's Prickle-Prickle, the 50th of Bureaucracy, 3161.
Celebrate Bureflux

% ddate +"Today's %{%A, the %e of %B%}, %Y. %N%nCelebrate %H" 29 2 1996
Today's St. Tib's Day, 3162.

 
BUGS
ddate(1) will
      produce undefined behavior if asked to produce the date for
      St. Tib's day and its format string does not contain the St.
      Tib's Day delimiters %{ and %}.

 
NOTE
After `X-Day' passed without incident, the Church of the
      SubGenius declared that it had got the year upside down -
      X-Day is actually in 8661 AD rather than 1998 AD. Thus, the
      True X-Day is Cfn 40, 9827.
