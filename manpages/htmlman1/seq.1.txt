Synopsis

seq [OPTION...] LAST

seq [OPTION...] FIRST LAST

seq [OPTION...] FIRST INCREMENT LAST

 
DESCRIPTION
Print numbers from FIRST to LAST, in steps of
      INCREMENT.

−f, −−format=FORMAT

use printf style floating−point FORMAT

−s, −−separator=STRING

use STRING to separate numbers (default: \n)

−w, −−equal−width

equalize width by padding with leading zeroes

−−help

display this help and exit

−−version

output version information and exit

If FIRST or INCREMENT is omitted, it defaults to 1. That
      is, an omitted INCREMENT defaults to 1 even when LAST is
      smaller than FIRST. FIRST, INCREMENT, and LAST are
      interpreted as floating point values. INCREMENT is usually
      positive if FIRST is smaller than LAST, and INCREMENT is
      usually negative if FIRST is greater than LAST. FORMAT must
      be suitable for printing one argument of type `double'; it
      defaults to %.PRECf if FIRST, INCREMENT, and LAST are all
      fixed point decimal numbers with maximum precision PREC, and
      to %g otherwise.
