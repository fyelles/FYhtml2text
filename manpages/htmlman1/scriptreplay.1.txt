Name
scriptreplay — play back typescripts, using timing
      information

Synopsis

scriptreplay timingfile [
        typescript [divisor] ]

 
DESCRIPTION
This program replays a typescript, using timing
      information to ensure that output happens at the same speed
      as it originally appeared when the script was recorded.
The replay simply displays the information again; the
      programs that were run when the typescript was being recorded
      are not run again. Since the same information is simply being
      displayed, scriptreplay is only
      guaranteed to work properly if run on the same type of
      terminal the typescript was recorded on. Otherwise, any
      escape characters in the typescript may be interpreted
      differently by the terminal to which scriptreplay is sending its
      output.
The timings information is what script(1) outputs to
      standard error if it is run with the −t parameter.
By default, the typescript to display is assumed to be
      named “typescript”, but other filenames may be
      specified, as the second parameter.
If the third parameter is specified, it is used as a
      speed-up multiplier. For example, a speed-up of 2 makes
      scriptreplay go
      twice as fast and a speed-up of 0.1 makes it go ten times
      slower than the original session.

 
EXAMPLE

 % script -t 2> timingfile
 Script started, file is typescript
 % ls
 <etc, etc>
 % exit
 Script done, file is typescript
 % scriptreplay timingfile
