Name
srptool — Simple SRP password tool

Synopsis

 
DESCRIPTION
Very simple program that emulates the programs in the
      Stanford SRP (Secure Remote Password) libraries using GnuTLS.
      It is intended for use in places where you don't expect SRP
      authentication to be the used for system users.
In brief, to use SRP you need to create two files. These
      are the password file that holds the users and the verifiers
      associated with them and the configuration file to hold the
      group parameters (called tpasswd.conf).

 
OPTIONS

−−bits BITS

specify the number of bits for prime numbers (used
            only when the −−create−conf option
            is used).

−−create−conf FILE

Generate a tpasswd.conf file.

−h,
          −−help

Prints a short reminder of the command line
            options.

−i,
          −−index INDEX

Specify the index of the parameters in tpasswd.conf
            to use.

−p,
          −−passwd FILE

Specify a password file.

−c,
          −−passwd−conf FILE

Specify a password configuration file.

−s,
          −−salt SALT

Specify salt size for crypt algorithm.

−u,
          −−username username

Specify username.

−−verify

Just verify password.

 
EXAMPLES
To create tpasswd.conf which holds the g and n values for
      SRP protocol (generator and a large prime), run:

$ srptool −−create−conf /etc/tpasswd.conf

This command will create /etc/tpasswd and will add user
      'test' (you will also be prompted for a password). Verifiers
      are stored by default in the way libsrp expects.

$ srptool −−passwd /etc/tpasswd \
    −−passwd−conf /etc/tpasswd.conf −u test

This command will check against a password. If the
      password matches the one in /etc/tpasswd you will get an
      ok.

$ srptool −−passwd /etc/tpasswd \
    −−passwd−conf /etc/tpasswd.conf −−verify −u test
