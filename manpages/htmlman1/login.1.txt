DESCRIPTION
login is
      used when signing onto a system.
If an argument is not given, login prompts for the
      username.
If the user is not root, and if /etc/nologin exists, the contents of this
      file are printed to the screen, and the login is terminated.
      This is typically used to prevent logins when the system is
      being taken down.
If special access restrictions are specified for the user
      in /etc/usertty, these must be
      met, or the log in attempt will be denied and a “syslog” message will be
      generated. See the section on "Special Access
      Restrictions".
If the user is root, then the login must be occurring on a
      tty listed in /etc/securetty.
      Failures will be logged with the “syslog” facility.
After these conditions have been checked, the password
      will be requested and checked (if a password is required for
      this username). Ten attempts are allowed before login dies, but after the
      first three, the response starts to get very slow. Login
      failures are reported via the “syslog” facility. This facility
      is also used to report any successful root logins.
If the file .hushlogin exists, then a
      "quiet" login is performed (this disables the checking of
      mail and the printing of the last login time and message of
      the day). Otherwise, if /var/log/lastlog exists, the last login
      time is printed (and the current login is recorded).
Random administrative things, such as setting the UID and
      GID of the tty are performed. The TERM environment variable
      is preserved, if it exists (other environment variables are
      preserved if the −p option
      is used). Then the HOME, PATH, SHELL, TERM, MAIL, and LOGNAME
      environment variables are set. PATH defaults to /usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin for normal
      users, and to /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
      for root. Last, if this is not a "quiet" login, the message
      of the day is printed and the file with the user's name in
      /var/spool/mail will be
      checked, and a message printed if it has non-zero length.
The user's shell is then started. If no shell is specified
      for the user in /etc/passwd,
      then /bin/sh is used. If there
      is no directory specified in /etc/passwd, then / is used (the home directory is checked
      for the .hushlogin
      file described above).

 
OPTIONS

−p

Used by getty(8) to tell
            login not
            to destroy the environment

−f

Used to skip a second login authentication. This
            specifically does not work for root, and does not
            appear to work well under Linux.

−h

Used by other servers (i.e., telnetd(8)) to pass the
            name of the remote host to login so that it may
            be placed in utmp and wtmp. Only the superuser may use
            this option.
Note that the −h option has
            impact on the PAM service
            name. The standard service name is "login",
            with the −h option the name
            is "remote". It's necessary to create a proper PAM
            config files (e.g. /etc/pam.d/login and /etc/pam.d/remote ).

 
SPECIAL ACCESS RESTRICTIONS
The file /etc/securetty
      lists the names of the ttys where root is allowed to log in.
      One name of a tty device without the /dev/ prefix must be
      specified on each line. If the file does not exist, root is
      allowed to log in on any tty.
On most modern Linux systems PAM (Pluggable Authentication
      Modules) is used. On systems that do not use PAM, the file
      /etc/usertty specifies
      additional access restrictions for specific users. If this
      file does not exist, no additional access restrictions are
      imposed. The file consists of a sequence of sections. There
      are three possible section types: CLASSES, GROUPS and USERS.
      A CLASSES section defines classes of ttys and hostname
      patterns, A GROUPS section defines allowed ttys and hosts on
      a per group basis, and a USERS section defines allowed ttys
      and hosts on a per user basis.
Each line in this file in may be no longer than 255
      characters. Comments start with # character and extend to the
      end of the line.

 
The CLASSES Section
A CLASSES section begins with the word CLASSES at the
        start of a line in all upper case. Each following line
        until the start of a new section or the end of the file
        consists of a sequence of words separated by tabs or
        spaces. Each line defines a class of ttys and host
        patterns.
The word at the beginning of a line becomes defined as a
        collective name for the ttys and host patterns specified at
        the rest of the line. This collective name can be used in
        any subsequent GROUPS or USERS section. No such class name
        must occur as part of the definition of a class in order to
        avoid problems with recursive classes.
An example CLASSES section:

CLASSES
myclass1                tty1 tty2
myclass2                tty3 @.foo.com

This defines the classes myclass1 and myclass2 as the
            corresponding right hand sides.

 
The GROUPS Section
A GROUPS section defines allowed ttys and hosts on a per
        Unix group basis. If a user is a member of a Unix group
        according to /etc/passwd and
        /etc/group and such a group
        is mentioned in a GROUPS section in /etc/usertty then the user is granted
        access if the group is.
A GROUPS section starts with the word GROUPS in all
        upper case at the start of a line, and each following line
        is a sequence of words separated by spaces or tabs. The
        first word on a line is the name of the group and the rest
        of the words on the line specifies the ttys and hosts where
        members of that group are allowed access. These
        specifications may involve the use of classes defined in
        previous CLASSES sections.
An example GROUPS section.

GROUPS
sys             tty1 @.bar.edu
stud            myclass1 tty4

This example specifies that members of group
            sys may log in on tty1
            and from hosts in the bar.edu domain. Users in group
            stud may log in from
            hosts/ttys specified in the class myclass1 or from
            tty4.

 
The USERS Section
A USERS section starts with the word USERS in all upper
        case at the start of a line, and each following line is a
        sequence of words separated by spaces or tabs. The first
        word on a line is a username and that user is allowed to
        log in on the ttys and from the hosts mentioned on the rest
        of the line. These specifications may involve classes
        defined in previous CLASSES sections. If no section header
        is specified at the top of the file, the first section
        defaults to be a USERS section.
An example USERS section:

USERS
zacho           tty1 @130.225.16.0/255.255.255.0
blue            tty3 myclass2

This lets the user zacho login only on tty1 and from
            hosts with IP addreses in the range 130.225.16.0
            − 130.225.16.255, and user blue is allowed to log
            in from tty3 and whatever is specified in the class
            myclass2.
There may be a line in a USERS section starting with
            a username of *. This is a default rule and it will be
            applied to any user not matching any other line.
If both a USERS line and GROUPS line match a user
            then the user is allowed access from the union of all
            the ttys/hosts mentioned in these specifications.

 
Origins
The tty and host pattern specifications used in the
        specification of classes, group and user access are called
        origins. An origin string may have one of these
        formats:

The name of a tty device without the /dev/ prefix,
              for example tty1 or ttyS0.

The string @localhost, meaning that the user is
              allowed to telnet/rlogin from the local host to the
              same host. This also allows the user to for example
              run the command: xterm -e /bin/login.

A domain name suffix such as @.some.dom, meaning
              that the user may rlogin/telnet from any host whose
              domain name has the suffix .some.dom.

A range of IPv4 addresses, written
              @x.x.x.x/y.y.y.y where x.x.x.x is the IP address in
              the usual dotted quad decimal notation, and y.y.y.y
              is a bitmask in the same notation specifying which
              bits in the address to compare with the IP address of
              the remote host. For example
              @130.225.16.0/255.255.254.0 means that the user may
              rlogin/telnet from any host whose IP address is in
              the range 130.225.16.0 − 130.225.17.255.

An range of IPv6 addresses, written
              @[n:n:n:n:n:n:n:n]/m is interpreted as a
              [net]/prefixlen pair. An IPv6 host address is matched
              if prefixlen bits of net is equal to the prefixlen
              bits of the address. For example, the [net]/prefixlen
              pattern [3ffe:505:2:1::]/64 matches every address in
              the range 3ffe:505:2:1:: through
              3ffe:505:2:1:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff.

Any of the above origins may be prefixed by a time
        specification according to the syntax:

timespec    ::= '[' <day-or-hour> [':' <day-or-hour>]* ']'
day         ::= 'mon' | 'tue' | 'wed' | 'thu' | 'fri' | 'sat' | 'sun'
hour        ::= '0' | '1' | ... | '23'
hourspec    ::= <hour> | <hour> '−' <hour>
day-or-hour ::= <day> | <hourspec>

For example, the origin
        [mon:tue:wed:thu:fri:8−17]tty3 means that log in is
        allowed on mondays through fridays between 8:00 and 17:59
        (5:59 pm) on tty3. This also shows that an hour range
        a−b includes all moments between a:00 and b:59. A
        single hour specification (such as 10) means the time span
        between 10:00 and 10:59.
Not specifying any time prefix for a tty or host means
        log in from that origin is allowed any time. If you give a
        time prefix be sure to specify both a set of days and one
        or more hours or hour ranges. A time specification may not
        include any white space.
If no default rule is given then users not matching any
        line /etc/usertty are allowed
        to log in from anywhere as is standard behavior.

BUGS
The undocumented BSD −r
      option is not supported. This may be required by some
      rlogind(8) programs.
A recursive login, as used to be possible in the good old
      days, no longer works; for most purposes su(1) is a satisfactory
      substitute. Indeed, for security reasons, login does a
      vhangup() system call to remove any possible listening
      processes on the tty. This is to avoid password sniffing. If
      one uses the command "login", then the surrounding shell gets
      killed by vhangup() because it's no longer the true owner of
      the tty. This can be avoided by using "exec login" in a
      top-level shell or xterm.
