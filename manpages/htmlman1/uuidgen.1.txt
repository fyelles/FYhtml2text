Name
uuidgen — command−line utility to create a new
      UUID value

Synopsis

uuidgen [ −r | −t ]

 
DESCRIPTION
The uuidgen
      program creates (and prints) a new universally unique
      identifier (UUID) using the libuuid(3) library. The new
      UUID can reasonably be considered unique among all UUIDs
      created on the local system, and among UUIDs created on other
      systems in the past and in the future.
There are two types of UUIDs which uuidgen can generate:
      time-based UUIDs and random-based UUIDs. By default
      uuidgen will
      generate a random-based UUID if a high-quality random number
      generator is present. Otherwise, it will chose a time-based
      UUID. It is possible to force the generation of one of these
      two UUID types by using the −r or −t options.

 
OPTIONS

−r

Generate a random-based UUID. This method creates a
            UUID consisting mostly of random bits. It requires that
            the operating system have a high quality random number
            generator, such as /dev/random.

−t

Generate a time-based UUID. This method creates a
            UUID based on the system clock plus the system's
            ethernet hardware address, if present.
