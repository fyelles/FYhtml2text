Name
timeout — run a command with a time limit

Synopsis

timeout [OPTION] DURATION COMMAND [ARG...]

timeout [OPTION]

 
DESCRIPTION
Start COMMAND, and kill it if still running after
      DURATION.
Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for
      short options too.
−−foreground

When not running timeout directly from a shell
            prompt, allow COMMAND to read from the TTY and receive
            TTY signals. In this mode, children of COMMAND will not
            be timed out.
−k, −−kill−after=DURATION

also send a KILL signal if COMMAND is still running
            this long after the initial signal was sent.
−s, −−signal=SIGNAL

specify the signal to be sent on timeout. SIGNAL may
            be a name like `HUP' or a number. See `kill
            −l` for a list of
            signals

−−help

display this help and exit

−−version

output version information and exit

DURATION is a floating point number with an optional
      suffix: `s' for seconds (the default), `m' for minutes, `h'
      for hours or `d' for days.
If the command times out, then exit with status 124.
      Otherwise, exit with the status of COMMAND. If no signal is
      specified, send the TERM signal upon timeout. The TERM signal
      kills any process that does not block or catch that signal.
      For other processes, it may be necessary to use the KILL (9)
      signal, since this signal cannot be caught.
