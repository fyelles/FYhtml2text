split — split a file into pieces

Synopsis

split [OPTION...] [ INPUT [PREFIX] ]

 
DESCRIPTION
Output fixed−size pieces of INPUT to PREFIXaa,
      PREFIXab, ...; default size is 1000 lines, and default PREFIX
      is `x'. With no INPUT, or when INPUT is −, read
      standard input.
Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for
      short options too.

−a, −−suffix−length=N

use suffixes of length N (default 2)

−b, −−bytes=SIZE

put SIZE bytes per output file

−C, −−line−bytes=SIZE

put at most SIZE bytes of lines per output file

−d, −−numeric−suffixes

use numeric suffixes instead of alphabetic

−e, −−elide−empty−files

do not generate empty output files with
            `−n'

−−filter=COMMAND

write to shell COMMAND; file name is $FILE

−l, −−lines=NUMBER

put NUMBER lines per output file

−n, −−number=CHUNKS

generate CHUNKS output files. See below

−u, −−unbuffered

immediately copy input to output with `−n
            r/...'

−−verbose

print a diagnostic just before each output file is
            opened

−−help

display this help and exit

−−version

output version information and exit

SIZE may be (or may be an integer optionally followed by)
      one of following: KB 1000, K 1024, MB 1000*1000, M 1024*1024,
      and so on for G, T, P, E, Z, Y.
CHUNKS may be: N split into N files based on size of input
      K/N output Kth of N to stdout l/N split into N files without
      splitting lines l/K/N output Kth of N to stdout without
      splitting lines r/N like `l' but use round robin distribution
      r/K/N likewise but only output Kth of N to stdout
