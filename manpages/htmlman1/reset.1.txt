Name
reset — reset the terminal

Synopsis

reset

 
DESCRIPTION
reset calls
      tput(1) with the clear, rmacs,
      rmm, rmul, rs1,
      rs2, and rs3 arguments. This causes tput to send appropriate
      reset strings to the terminal based on information in
      /etc/termcap (for the GNU or
      BSD tput) or in
      the terminfo database (for the ncurses tput). This sequence seems
      to be sufficient to reset the Linux VC's when they start
      printing "funny-looking" characters. For good measure,
      stty(1) is called with the
      sane argument
      in an attempt to get cooked mode back.

 
SEE ALSO
clear(1), stty(1), tput(1)
