Name
ln — make links between files

Synopsis

ln [OPTION...] [−T] TARGET LINK_NAME (1st form)

ln [OPTION...] TARGET (2nd form)

ln [OPTION...] TARGET... DIRECTORY (3rd form)

ln [OPTION...] −t DIRECTORY TARGET... (4th form)

 
DESCRIPTION
In the 1st form, create a link to TARGET with the name
      LINK_NAME. In the 2nd form, create a link to TARGET in the
      current directory. In the 3rd and 4th forms, create links to
      each TARGET in DIRECTORY. Create hard links by default,
      symbolic links with −−symbolic. When creating hard
      links, each TARGET must exist. Symbolic links can hold
      arbitrary text; if later resolved, a relative link is
      interpreted in relation to its parent directory.
Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for
      short options too.

−−backup[=CONTROL]

make a backup of each existing destination file

−b

like −−backup but does not
            accept an argument

−d, −F, −−directory

allow the superuser to attempt to hard link
            directories (note: will probably fail due to system
            restrictions, even for the superuser)

−f, −−force

remove existing destination files

−i, −−interactive

prompt whether to remove destinations

−L, −−logical

make hard links to symbolic link references

−n, −−no−dereference

treat destination that is a symlink to a directory
            as if it were a normal file

−P, −−physical

make hard links directly to symbolic links

−s, −−symbolic

make symbolic links instead of hard links

−S, −−suffix=SUFFIX

override the usual backup suffix

−t, −−target−directory=DIRECTORY

specify the DIRECTORY in which to create the
            links

−T, −−no−target−directory

treat LINK_NAME as a normal file

−v, −−verbose

print name of each linked file

−−help

display this help and exit

−−version

output version information and exit

The backup suffix is `~', unless set with −−suffix or SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX.
      The version control method may be selected via the
      −−backup option or
      through the VERSION_CONTROL environment variable. Here are
      the values:
Using −s ignores
      −L and −P. Otherwise, the last option
      specified controls behavior when the source is a symbolic
      link, defaulting to −P.

none, off

never make backups (even if −−backup is given)

numbered, t

make numbered backups

existing, nil

numbered if numbered backups exist, simple
            otherwise

simple, never

always make simple backups
