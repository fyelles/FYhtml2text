Name
lscpu — CPU architecture information helper

Synopsis

lscpu [−hpx] [ −s directory ]

 
DESCRIPTION
lscpu
      gathers CPU architecture information like number of CPUs,
      threads, cores, sockets, NUMA nodes, information about CPU
      caches, CPU family, model, bogoMIPS, byte order and stepping
      from sysfs and /proc/cpuinfo, and prints it in a
      human-readable format. It supports both online and offline
      CPUs. It can also print out in a parsable format, including
      how different caches are shared by different CPUs, which can
      be fed to other programs.

 
OPTIONS

−h,
          −−help

Print a help message.

−p,
          −−parse

Print out in parsable instead of human-readable
            format.

−s,
          −−sysroot directory

Use the specified directory as system root.
            This allows you to inspect a snapshot from a different
            system.

−x,
          −−hex

Use hexadecimal masks for CPU sets (e.g. 0x3). The
            default is to print the sets in list format (e.g.
            0,1).

 
BUGS
The basic overview about CPU family, model, etc. is always
      based on the first CPU only.
Sometimes in Xen Dom0 the kernel reports wrong data.
