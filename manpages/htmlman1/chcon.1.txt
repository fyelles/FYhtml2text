Name
chcon — change file security context

Synopsis

chcon [OPTION...] CONTEXT FILE...

chcon [OPTION...] [ −u USER ] [ −r ROLE ] [ −l RANGE ] [ −t TYPE ] FILE...

chcon [OPTION...] −−reference=RFILE FILE...

 
DESCRIPTION
Change the security context of each FILE to CONTEXT. With
      −−reference, change
      the security context of each FILE to that of RFILE.

−h, −−no−dereference

affect symbolic links instead of any referenced
            file

−−reference=RFILE

use RFILE's security context rather than specifying
            a CONTEXT value

−R, −−recursive

operate on files and directories recursively

−v, −−verbose

output a diagnostic for every file processed

−u, −−user=USER

set user USER in the target security context

−r, −−role=ROLE

set role ROLE in the target security context

−t, −−type=TYPE

set type TYPE in the target security context

−l, −−range=RANGE

set range RANGE in the target security context

The following options modify how a hierarchy is traversed
      when the −R option is also
      specified. If more than one is specified, only the final one
      takes effect.

−H

if a command line argument is a symbolic link to a
            directory, traverse it

−L

traverse every symbolic link to a directory
            encountered

−P

do not traverse any symbolic links (default)

−−help

display this help and exit

−−version

output version information and exit
