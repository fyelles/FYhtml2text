Synopsis

last [−number] [ −f filename ] [ −t tty ] [ −h hostname ] [ −i address ] [−l] [−y] [ name... ]

 
DESCRIPTION
Last looks
      back in the wtmp file which records all
      logins and logouts for information about a user, a teletype
      or any group of users and teletypes. Arguments specify names
      of users or teletypes of interest. If multiple arguments are
      given, the information which applies to any of the arguments
      is printed. For example ``last
      rootconsole'' would list all of root's sessions
      as well as all sessions on the console terminal. Last displays the sessions
      of the specified users and teletypes, most recent first,
      indicating the times at which the session began, the duration
      of the session, and the teletype which the session took place
      on. If the session is still continuing or was cut short by a
      reboot, last so
      indicates.
The pseudo-user reboot logs in at reboots of
      the system.
Last with no
      arguments displays a record of all logins and logouts, in
      reverse order.
If last is
      interrupted, it indicates how far the search has progressed
      in wtmp. If
      interrupted with a quit signal last indicates how far the
      search has progressed so far, and the search continues.
