setterm — set terminal attributes

Synopsis

setterm [options]

 
DESCRIPTION
setterm
      writes to standard output a character string that will invoke
      the specified terminal capabilities. Where possible
      terminfo is
      consulted to find the string to use. Some options however
      (marked "virtual consoles only" below) do not correspond to a
      terminfo(5) capability. In this
      case, if the terminal type is "con" or "linux" the string
      that invokes the specified capabilities on the PC Minix
      virtual console driver is output. Options that are not
      implemented by the terminal are ignored.

 
OPTIONS
For boolean options (“on” or
      “off”), the default is “on”.
For conciseness, an 8-color
      below is black, red, green,
      yellow, blue, magenta,
      cyan, or white.
A 16-color is an 8-color, grey,
      or bright followed by
      red, green, yellow,
      blue, magenta, cyan,
      or white.
The various color options may be set independently, at
      least at virtual consoles, though the results of setting
      multiple modes (for example, −underline and −half−bright) are
      hardware-dependent.

−term
          terminal_name

Overrides the TERM environment variable.

−reset

Displays the terminal reset string, which typically
            resets the terminal to its power on state.

−initialize

Displays the terminal initialization string, which
            typically sets the terminal's rendering options, and
            other attributes to the default values.

−cursor
          [on|off]

Turns the terminal's cursor on or off.

−repeat
          [on|off] (virtual consoles only)

Turns keyboard repeat on or off.

−appcursorkeys [on|off] (virtual consoles
          only)

Sets Cursor Key Application Mode on or off. When on,
            ESC O A, ESC O B, etc. will be sent for the cursor keys
            instead of ESC [ A, ESC [ B, etc. See the "vi and
            Cursor-Keys" section of the Text-Terminal-HOWTO for how
            this can cause problems for vi users.

−linewrap [on|off] (virtual consoles
          only)

Turns automatic line-wrapping on or off.

−default

Sets the terminal's rendering options to the default
            values.

−foreground 8-color|default (virtual
          consoles only)

Sets the foreground text color.

−background 8-color|default (virtual
          consoles only)

Sets the background text color.

−ulcolor 16-color (virtual consoles
          only)

Sets the color for underlined characters.

−hbcolor 16-color (virtual consoles
          only)

Sets the color for half-bright characters.

−inversescreen [on|off] (virtual consoles
          only)

Inverts the screen colors. Foreground and background
            are swapped, as are underline and half-brightness.

−bold
          [on|off]

Turns bold (extra bright) mode on or off. Except at
            a virtual console, −bold
            off turns off all attributes (bold,
            half-brightness, blink, reverse).

−half−bright
          [on|off]

Turns dim (half-brightness) mode on or off (see
            −hbcolor). Except at
            a virtual console, −half−bright off turns off
            all attributes (bold, half-brightness, blink,
            reverse).

−blink
          [on|off]

Turns blink mode on or off. Except at a virtual
            console, −blink off
            turns off all attributes (bold, half-brightness, blink,
            reverse).

−reverse [on|off]

Turns reverse video mode on or off. Except at a
            virtual console, −reverse
            off turns off all attributes (bold,
            half-brightness, blink, reverse).

−underline [on|off]

Turns underline mode on or off (see −ulcolor).

−store
          (virtual consoles only)

Stores the terminal's current rendering options
            (foreground and background colors) as the values to be
            used at reset-to-default.

−clear
          [all]

Clears the screen and "homes" the cursor, as
            clear(1).

−clearrest

Clears from the current cursor position to the end
            of the screen.

−tabs
          [tab1 tab2 tab3
          ...] (virtual consoles only)

Sets tab stops at the given horizontal cursor
            positions, in the range 1-160. Without arguments, shows
            the current tab stop settings.

−clrtabs [tab1
          tab2 tab3 ...] (virtual consoles
          only)

Clears tab stops from the given horizontal cursor
            positions, in the range 1-160. Without arguments,
            clears all tab stops.

−regtabs [1−160] (virtual
          consoles only)

Clears all tab stops, then sets a regular tab stop
            pattern, with one tab every specified number of
            positions. Without an argument, defaults to 8.

−blank
          [0−60|force|poke] (virtual consoles
          only)

Sets the interval of inactivity, in minutes, after
            which the screen will be automatically blanked (using
            APM if available). Without an argument, gets the blank
            status (returns which vt was blanked or zero for
            unblanked vt).
The force option keeps
            screen blank even if a key is pressed.
The poke option unblank
            the screen.

−dump
          [1−NR_CONS]

Writes a snapshot of the given virtual console (with
            attributes) to the file specified in the −file option, overwriting its
            contents; the default is screen.dump. Without an
            argument, dumps the current virtual console. Overrides
            −append.

−append
          [1−NR_CONS]

Like −dump, but
            appends to the snapshot file instead of overwriting it.
            Only works if no −dump options are given.

−file
          dumpfilename

Sets the snapshot file name for any −dump or −append options on the same
            command line. If this option is not present, the
            default is screen.dump in the current directory.

−msg
          [on|off] (virtual consoles only)

Enables or disables the sending of kernel
            printk() messages to the
            console.

−msglevel 1−8 (virtual
          consoles only)

Sets the console logging level for kernel
            printk() messages. All
            messages strictly more important than this will be
            printed, so a logging level of 0 has the same effect as
            −msg on and a logging
            level of 8 will print all kernel messages. klogd(8) may be a more
            convenient interface to the logging of kernel
            messages.

−powersave on|vsync

Puts the monitor into VESA vsync suspend mode.

−powersavehsync

Puts the monitor into VESA hsync suspend mode.

−powersavepowerdown

Puts the monitor into VESA powerdown mode.

−powersave [off]

Turns off monitor VESA powersaving features.

−powerdown [0−60]

Sets the VESA powerdown interval in minutes. Without
            an argument, defaults to 0 (disable powerdown). If the
            console is blanked or the monitor is in suspend mode,
            then the monitor will go into vsync suspend mode or
            powerdown mode respectively after this period of time
            has elapsed.

−blength [0−2000]

Sets the bell duration in milliseconds. Without an
            argument, defaults to 0.

−bfreq
          [freqnumber]

Sets the bell frequency in Hz. Without an argument,
            defaults to 0.
