Name
fallocate — preallocate space to a file.

Synopsis

fallocate [−n] [ −o offset ] −l length filename

 
DESCRIPTION
fallocate is
      used to preallocate blocks to a file. For filesystems which
      support the fallocate system call, this is done quickly by
      allocating blocks and marking them as uninitialized,
      requiring no IO to the data blocks. This is much faster than
      creating a file by filling it with zeros.
As of the Linux Kernel v2.6.31, the fallocate system call
      is supported by the btrfs, ext4, ocfs2, and xfs
      filesystems.
The exit code returned by fallocate is 0 on success
      and 1 on failure.

 
OPTIONS
The length and
      offset arguments may
      be followed by binary (2^N) suffixes KiB, MiB, GiB, TiB, PiB
      and EiB (the "iB" is optional, e.g. "K" has the same meaning
      as "KiB") or decimal (10^N) suffixes KB, MB, GB, PB and
      EB.

−h,
          −−help

Print help and exit.

−n,
          −−keep−size

Do not modify the apparent length of the file. This
            may effectively allocate blocks past EOF, which can be
            removed with a truncate.

−o,
          −−offset offset

Specifies the beginning offset of the allocation, in
            bytes.

−l,
          −−length length

Specifies the length of the allocation, in
            bytes.
