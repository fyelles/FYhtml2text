Name
od — dump files in octal and other formats

Synopsis

od [OPTION...] [FILE...]

od [−abcdfilosx...] [FILE] [[+]OFFSET[.][b]]

od −−traditional [OPTION...] [FILE] [ [+]OFFSET[.][b] [+][LABEL][.][b] ]

 
DESCRIPTION
Write an unambiguous representation, octal bytes by
      default, of FILE to standard output. With more than one FILE
      argument, concatenate them in the listed order to form the
      input. With no FILE, or when FILE is −, read standard
      input.
All arguments to long options are mandatory for short
      options.

−A, −−address−radix=RADIX

decide how file offsets are printed

−j, −−skip−bytes=BYTES

skip BYTES input bytes first

−N, −−read−bytes=BYTES

limit dump to BYTES input bytes

−S, −−strings[=BYTES]

output strings of at least BYTES graphic chars

−t, −−format=TYPE

select output format or formats

−v, −−output−duplicates

do not use * to mark line suppression

−w, −−width[=BYTES]

output BYTES bytes per output line

−−traditional

accept arguments in traditional form

−−help

display this help and exit

−−version

output version information and exit

 
Traditional format specifications may be intermixed;
        they accumulate:

−a

same as −t a,
              select named characters, ignoring high−order
              bit

−b

same as −t o1,
              select octal bytes

−c

same as −t c,
              select ASCII characters or backslash escapes

−d

same as −t u2,
              select unsigned decimal 2−byte units

−f

same as −t fF,
              select floats

−i

same as −t dI,
              select decimal ints

−l

same as −t dL,
              select decimal longs

−o

same as −t o2,
              select octal 2−byte units

−s

same as −t d2,
              select decimal 2−byte units

−x

same as −t x2,
              select hexadecimal 2−byte units

If first and second call formats both apply, the second
        format is assumed if the last operand begins with + or (if
        there are 2 operands) a digit. An OFFSET operand means
        −j OFFSET. LABEL is the
        pseudo−address at first byte printed, incremented
        when dump is progressing. For OFFSET and LABEL, a 0x or 0X
        prefix indicates hexadecimal; suffixes may be . for octal
        and b for multiply by 512.
TYPE is made up of one or more of these
        specifications:

a

named character, ignoring high−order bit

c

ASCII character or backslash escape

d[SIZE]

signed decimal, SIZE bytes per integer

f[SIZE]

floating point, SIZE bytes per integer

o[SIZE]

octal, SIZE bytes per integer

u[SIZE]

unsigned decimal, SIZE bytes per integer

x[SIZE]

hexadecimal, SIZE bytes per integer

SIZE is a number. For TYPE in doux, SIZE may also be C
        for sizeof(char), S for sizeof(short), I for sizeof(int) or
        L for sizeof(long). If TYPE is f, SIZE may also be F for
        sizeof(float), D for sizeof(double) or L for sizeof(long
        double).
RADIX is d for decimal, o for octal, x for hexadecimal
        or n for none. BYTES is hexadecimal with 0x or 0X prefix,
        and may have a multiplier suffix: b 512, kB 1000, K 1024,
        MB 1000*1000, M 1024*1024, GB 1000*1000*1000, G
        1024*1024*1024, and so on for T, P, E, Z, Y. Adding a z
        suffix to any type displays printable characters at the end
        of each output line. Option −−string without a number
        implies 3; option −−width without a number
        implies 32. By default, od uses −A o −t oS −w16.
