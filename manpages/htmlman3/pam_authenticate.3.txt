Synopsis

 

#include <security/pam_appl.h>

int
            pam_authenticate(
pam_handle_t *pamh,

 
int flags);

           
        

 
DESCRIPTION
The pam_authenticate
      function is used to authenticate the user. The user is
      required to provide an authentication token depending upon
      the authentication service, usually this is a password, but
      could also be a finger print.
The PAM service module may request that the user enter
      their username vio the the conversation mechanism (see
      pam_start(3) and pam_conv(3)). The name of
      the authenticated user will be present in the PAM item
      PAM_USER. This item may be recovered with a call to pam_get_item(3).
The pamh argument
      is an authentication handle obtained by a prior call to
      pam_start(). The flags argument is the binary or of zero or
      more of the following values:

PAM_SILENT

Do not emit any messages.

PAM_DISALLOW_NULL_AUTHTOK

The PAM module service should return PAM_AUTH_ERR if
            the user does not have a registered authentication
            token.

 
RETURN VALUES

PAM_ABORT

The application should exit immediately after
            calling pam_end(3) first.

PAM_AUTH_ERR

The user was not authenticated.

PAM_CRED_INSUFFICIENT

For some reason the application does not have
            sufficient credentials to authenticate the user.

PAM_AUTHINFO_UNVAIL

The modules were not able to access the
            authentication information. This might be due to a
            network or hardware failure etc.

PAM_MAXTRIES

One or more of the authentication modules has
            reached its limit of tries authenticating the user. Do
            not try again.

PAM_SUCCESS

The user was successfully authenticated.

PAM_USER_UNKNOWN

User unknown to authentication service.
