DESCRIPTION
These routines are used to step through the messages in a
      result chain received from ldap_result(3). For search
      operations, the result chain can contain referral, entry and
      result messages. The ldap_msgtype(3) function can be
      used to distinguish between the different message types.
The ldap_first_message()
      routine is used to retrieve the first message in a result
      chain. It takes the result as returned by a call to
      ldap_result(3), ldap_search_s(3) or
      ldap_search_st(3) and
      returns a pointer to the first message in the result
      chain.
This pointer should be supplied on a subsequent call to
      ldap_next_message() to get the
      next message, the result of which should be supplied to the
      next call to ldap_next_message(), etc.
      ldap_next_message() will return
      NULL when there are no more messages.
These functions are useful when using routines like
      ldap_parse_result(3) that
      only operate on the first result in the chain.
A count of the number of messages in the result chain can
      be obtained by calling ldap_count_messages(). It can also
      be used to count the number of remaining messages in a chain
      if called with a message, entry or reference returned by
      ldap_first_message() ,
      ldap_next_message() , ldap_first_entry(3),
      ldap_next_entry(3),
      ldap_first_reference(3),
      ldap_next_reference(3).

 
ERRORS
If an error occurs in ldap_first_message() or ldap_next_message(), NULL is
      returned. If an error occurs in ldap_count_messages(), -1 is
      returned.
