#include <security/pam_appl.h>

int
            pam_open_session(
pam_handle_t *pamh,

 
int flags);

           
        

 
DESCRIPTION
The pam_open_session
      function sets up a user session for a previously successful
      authenticated user. The session should later be terminated
      with a call to pam_close_session(3).
It should be noted that the effective uid, geteuid(2). of the
      application should be of sufficient privilege to perform such
      tasks as creating or mounting the user's home directory for
      example.
The flags argument is the binary or of zero or more of the
      following values:

PAM_SILENT

Do not emit any messages.

 
RETURN VALUES

PAM_ABORT

General failure.

PAM_BUF_ERR

Memory buffer error.

PAM_SESSION_ERR

Session failure.

PAM_SUCCESS

Session was successful created.
