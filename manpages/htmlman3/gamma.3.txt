DESCRIPTION
These functions are deprecated: instead, use either the
      tgamma(3) or the lgamma(3) functions, as
      appropriate.
For the definition of the Gamma function, see tgamma(3).

 
*BSD version
The libm in 4.4BSD and some versions of FreeBSD had a
        gamma() function that
        computes the Gamma function, as one would expect.

 
glibc version
Glibc has a gamma()
        function that is equivalent to lgamma(3) and computes
        the natural logarithm of the Gamma function.

 
RETURN VALUE
See lgamma(3).

 
ERRORS
See lgamma(3).

 
CONFORMING TO
Because of historical variations in behavior across
      systems, this function is not specified in any standard.

 
NOTES

 
History
4.2BSD had a gamma() that
        computed ln(|Gamma(|x|)|), leaving the sign of
        Gamma(|x|) in the
        external integer signgam. In
        4.3BSD the name was changed to lgamma(3), and the man
        page promises

"At some time in the future the name gamma will be
            rehabilitated and used for the Gamma function"

This did indeed happen in 4.4BSD, where gamma() computes the Gamma function (with
        no effect on signgam).
        However, this came too late, and we now have tgamma(3), the "true
        gamma" function.
