DESCRIPTION
These routines are used to perform a LDAP rename
      operation. The function changes the leaf component of an
      entry's distinguished name and optionally moves the entry to
      a new parent container. The ldap_rename_s performs a rename operation
      synchronously. The method takes dn, which points to the
      distinguished name of the entry whose attribute is being
      compared, newparent,the distinguished
      name of the entry's new parent. If this parameter is NULL,
      only the RDN is changed. The root DN is specified by passing
      a zero length string, "". deleteoldrdn specifies whether
      the old RDN should be retained or deleted. Zero indicates
      that the old RDN should be retained. If you choose this
      option, the attribute will contain both names (the old and
      the new). Non-zero indicates that the old RDN should be
      deleted. serverctrls
      points to an array of LDAPControl structures that list the
      client controls to use with this extended operation. Use NULL
      to specify no client controls. clientctrls points to an array
      of LDAPControl structures that list the client controls to
      use with the search.
ldap_rename works just like
      ldap_rename_s, but
      the operation is asynchronous. It returns the message id of
      the request it initiated. The result of this operation can be
      obtained by calling ldap_result(3).

 
ERRORS
ldap_rename() returns
      −1 in case of error initiating the request, and will
      set the ld_errno field in the
      ld parameter to
      indicate the error. ldap_rename_s() returns the LDAP error code
      resulting from the rename operation.
