Name
iswlower — test for lowercase wide character

Synopsis

#include <wctype.h>

int
            iswlower(
wint_t wc);

           
        

 
DESCRIPTION
The iswlower() function is
      the wide-character equivalent of the islower(3) function. It
      tests whether wc is a
      wide character belonging to the wide-character class
      "lower".
The wide-character class "lower" is a subclass of the
      wide-character class "alpha", and therefore also a subclass
      of the wide-character class "alnum", of the wide-character
      class "graph" and of the wide-character class "print".
Being a subclass of the wide-character class "print", the
      wide-character class "lower" is disjoint from the
      wide-character class "cntrl".
Being a subclass of the wide-character class "graph", the
      wide-character class "lower" is disjoint from the
      wide-character class "space" and its subclass "blank".
Being a subclass of the wide-character class "alnum", the
      wide-character class "lower" is disjoint from the
      wide-character class "punct".
Being a subclass of the wide-character class "alpha", the
      wide-character class "lower" is disjoint from the
      wide-character class "digit".
The wide-character class "lower" contains at least those
      characters wc which
      are equal to towlower(wc) and different
      from towupper(wc).
The wide-character class "lower" always contains at least
      the letters 'a' to 'z'.

 
RETURN VALUE
The iswlower() function
      returns nonzero if wc
      is a wide character belonging to the wide-character class
      "lower". Otherwise it returns zero.

 
CONFORMING TO
C99.

 
NOTES
The behavior of iswlower()
      depends on the LC_CTYPE
      category of the current locale.
This function is not very appropriate for dealing with
      Unicode characters, because Unicode knows about three cases:
      upper, lower and title case.
