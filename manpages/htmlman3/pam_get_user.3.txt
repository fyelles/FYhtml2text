Synopsis

 

#include <security/pam_modules.h>

int
            pam_get_user(
const pam_handle_t *pamh,

 
const char **user,

 
const char *prompt);

           
        

 
DESCRIPTION
The pam_get_user function
      returns the name of the user specified by pam_start(3). If no user
      was specified it what pam_get_item
      (pamh, PAM_USER, ... ); would have returned. If this
      is NULL it obtains the username via the pam_conv(3) mechanism, it
      prompts the user with the first non-NULL string in the
      following list:

The prompt
            argument passed to the function.

What is returned by pam_get_item (pamh,
            PAM_USER_PROMPT, ... );

The default prompt: "login: "

By whatever means the username is obtained, a pointer to
      it is returned as the contents of *user. Note, this memory should
      not be free()'d or modified by the module.
This function sets the PAM_USER item associated with the
      pam_set_item(3) and
      pam_get_item(3)
      functions.

 
RETURN VALUES

PAM_SUCCESS

User name was successful retrieved.

PAM_SYSTEM_ERR

A NULL pointer was submitted.

PAM_CONV_ERR

The conversation method supplied by the application
            failed to obtain the username.
