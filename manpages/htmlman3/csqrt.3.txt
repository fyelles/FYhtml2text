DESCRIPTION
Calculate the square root of a given complex number, with
      nonnegative real part, and with a branch cut along the
      negative real axis. (That means that csqrt(−1+eps*I) will be
      close to I while csqrt(−1−eps*I)
      will be close to −I, if
      eps is a small positive real number.)

 
VERSIONS
These functions first appeared in glibc in version
      2.1.

 
CONFORMING TO
C99.
