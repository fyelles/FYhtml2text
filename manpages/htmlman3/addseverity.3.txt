Note

Feature Test Macro Requirements
                      for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

addseverity():

_SVID_SOURCE

 
DESCRIPTION
This function allows the introduction of new severity
      classes which can be addressed by the severity argument of the
      fmtmsg(3) function. By
      default that latter function only knows how to print messages
      for severity 0-4 (with strings (none), HALT, ERROR, WARNING,
      INFO). This call attaches the given string s to the given value severity. If s is NULL, the severity class
      with the numeric value severity is removed. It is not
      possible to overwrite or remove one of the default severity
      classes. The severity value must be nonnegative.

 
RETURN VALUE
Upon success, the value MM_OK is returned. Upon error, the return
      value is MM_NOTOK. Possible
      errors include: out of memory, attempt to remove a
      nonexistent or default severity class.

 
VERSIONS
addseverity() is provided in
      glibc since version 2.1.

 
CONFORMING TO
This function is not specified in the X/Open Portability
      Guide although the fmtmsg(3) function is. It
      is available on System V systems.

 
NOTES
New severity classes can also be added by setting the
      environment variable SEV_LEVEL.
