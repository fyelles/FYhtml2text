Name
mbsinit — test for initial shift state

Synopsis

#include <wchar.h>

int
            mbsinit(
const mbstate_t *ps);

           
        

 
DESCRIPTION
Character conversion between the multibyte representation
      and the wide character representation uses conversion state,
      of type mbstate_t. Conversion of a
      string uses a finite-state machine; when it is interrupted
      after the complete conversion of a number of characters, it
      may need to save a state for processing the remaining
      characters. Such a conversion state is needed for the sake of
      encodings such as ISO-2022 and UTF-7.
The initial state is the state at the beginning of
      conversion of a string. There are two kinds of state: The one
      used by multibyte to wide character conversion functions,
      such as mbsrtowcs(3), and the one
      used by wide character to multibyte conversion functions,
      such as wcsrtombs(3), but they both
      fit in a mbstate_t, and they both
      have the same representation for an initial state.
For 8-bit encodings, all states are equivalent to the
      initial state. For multibyte encodings like UTF-8, EUC-*,
      BIG5 or SJIS, the wide character to multibyte conversion
      functions never produce non-initial states, but the multibyte
      to wide-character conversion functions like mbrtowc(3) do produce
      non-initial states when interrupted in the middle of a
      character.
One possible way to create an mbstate_t in initial state is to set it to
      zero:

    mbstate_t state;
    memset(&state,0,sizeof(mbstate_t));

On Linux, the following works as well, but might generate
      compiler warnings:

    mbstate_t state = { 0 };

The function mbsinit() tests
      whether *ps
      corresponds to an initial state.

 
RETURN VALUE
mbsinit() returns nonzero if
      *ps is an initial
      state, or if ps is a
      NULL pointer. Otherwise it returns 0.

 
CONFORMING TO
C99.

 
NOTES
The behavior of mbsinit()
      depends on the LC_CTYPE
      category of the current locale.
