#include <pcre.h>

int
            pcre_copy_named_substring(
const pcre *code,

 
const char *subject,

 
int *ovector,

 
int stringcount,

 
const char *stringname,

 
char *buffer,

 
int buffersize);

           
        

 
DESCRIPTION
This is a convenience function for extracting a captured
      substring, identified by name, into a given buffer. The
      arguments are:

 code          Pattern that was successfully matched
 subject       Subject that has been successfully matched
 ovector       Offset vector that pcre_exec() used
 stringcount   Value returned by pcre_exec()
 stringname    Name of the required substring
 buffer        Buffer to receive the string
 buffersize    Size of buffer

The yield is the length of the substring,
      PCRE_ERROR_NOMEMORY if the buffer was too small, or
      PCRE_ERROR_NOSUBSTRING if the string name is invalid.
There is a complete description of the PCRE native API in
      the pcreapi(3) page and a
      description of the POSIX API in the pcreposix(3) page.
