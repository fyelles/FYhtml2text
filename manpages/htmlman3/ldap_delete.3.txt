DESCRIPTION
The ldap_delete_s() routine
      is used to perform an LDAP delete operation synchronously. It
      takes dn, the DN of
      the entry to be deleted. It returns an LDAP error code,
      indicating the success or failure of the operation.
The ldap_delete() routine is
      used to perform an LDAP delete operation asynchronously. It
      takes the same parameters as ldap_delete_s(), but returns the message id
      of the request it initiated. The result of the delete can be
      obtained by a subsequent call to ldap_result(3).
The ldap_delete_ext()
      routine allows server and client controls to be specified to
      extend the delete request. This routine is asynchronous like
      ldap_delete(), but its return value is an LDAP error code. It
      stores the message id of the request in the integer pointed
      to by msgidp.
The ldap_delete_ext_s()
      routine is the synchronous version of ldap_delete_ext(). It also returns an LDAP
      error code indicating success or failure of the
      operation.

 
ERRORS
ldap_delete_s() returns an
      LDAP error code which can be interpreted by calling one of
      ldap_perror(3) and friends.
      ldap_delete() returns −1
      if something went wrong initiating the request. It returns
      the non-negative message id of the request if things went
      ok.
ldap_delete_ext() and
      ldap_delete_ext_s() return some
      Non-zero value if something went wrong initiating the
      request, else return 0.
