Name
pam_getenvlist — getting the PAM environment

Synopsis

 

#include <security/pam_appl.h>

char
            **pam_getenvlist(
pam_handle_t *pamh);

           
        

 
DESCRIPTION
The pam_getenvlist function
      returns a complete copy of the PAM environment as associated
      with the handle pamh.
      The PAM environment variables represent the contents of the
      regular environment variables of the authenticated user when
      service is granted.
The format of the memory is a malloc()'d array of char
      pointers, the last element of which is set to NULL. Each of
      the non-NULL entries in this array point to a NUL terminated
      and malloc()'d char string of the form: "name=value".
It should be noted that this memory will never be free()'d
      by libpam. Once obtained by a call to pam_getenvlist, it is the responsibility of
      the calling application to free() this memory.
It is by design, and not a coincidence, that the format
      and contents of the returned array matches that required for
      the third argument of the execle(3) function
      call.

 
RETURN VALUES
The pam_getenvlist function
      returns NULL on failure.
