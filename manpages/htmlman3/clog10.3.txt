            clog10f(
float complex z);

DESCRIPTION
The call clog10(z) is equivalent to
      clog(z)/log(10).
      The other functions perform the same task for float and long
      double.
Note that z close
      to zero will cause an overflow.

 
VERSIONS
These functions first appeared in glibc in version
      2.1.

 
CONFORMING TO
This function is a GNU extension. It is reserved for
      future use in C99.
