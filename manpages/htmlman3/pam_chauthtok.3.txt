DESCRIPTION
The pam_chauthtok function
      is used to change the authentication token for a given user
      (as indicated by the state associated with the handle
      pamh).
The pamh argument
      is an authentication handle obtained by a prior call to
      pam_start(). The flags argument is the binary or of zero or
      more of the following values:

PAM_SILENT

Do not emit any messages.

PAM_CHANGE_EXPIRED_AUTHTOK

This argument indicates to the modules that the
            users authentication token (password) should only be
            changed if it has expired. If this argument is not
            passed, the application requires that all
            authentication tokens are to be changed.

 
RETURN VALUES

PAM_AUTHTOK_ERR

A module was unable to obtain the new authentication
            token.

PAM_AUTHTOK_RECOVERY_ERR

A module was unable to obtain the old authentication
            token.

PAM_AUTHTOK_LOCK_BUSY

One or more of the modules was unable to change the
            authentication token since it is currently locked.

PAM_AUTHTOK_DISABLE_AGING

Authentication token aging has been disabled for at
            least one of the modules.

PAM_PERM_DENIED

Permission denied.

PAM_SUCCESS

The authentication token was successfully
            updated.

PAM_TRY_AGAIN

Not all of the modules were in a position to update
            the authentication token(s). In such a case none of the
            user's authentication tokens are updated.

PAM_USER_UNKNOWN

User unknown to password service.
