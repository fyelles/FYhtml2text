Name
PCRE — Perl-compatible regular expressions

Synopsis

#include <pcre.h>

pcre_extra
            *pcre_study(
const pcre *code,

 
int options,

 
const char **errptr);

           
        

 
DESCRIPTION
This function studies a compiled pattern, to see if
      additional information can be extracted that might speed up
      matching. Its arguments are:

 code       A compiled regular expression
 options    Options for pcre_study()
 errptr     Where to put an error message

If the function succeeds, it returns a value that can be
      passed to pcre_exec() via its
      extra argument.
If the function returns NULL, either it could not find any
      additional information, or there was an error. You can tell
      the difference by looking at the error value. It is NULL in
      first case.
There are currently no options defined; the value of the
      second argument should always be zero.
There is a complete description of the PCRE native API in
      the pcreapi(3) page and a
      description of the POSIX API in the pcreposix(3) page.
