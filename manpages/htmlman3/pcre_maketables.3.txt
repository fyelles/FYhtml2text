PCRE — Perl-compatible regular expressions

Synopsis

#include <pcre.h>

const unsigned char
            *pcre_maketables(
void);
 

           
        

 
DESCRIPTION
This function builds a set of character tables for
      character values less than 256. These can be passed to
      pcre_compile() to override
      PCRE's internal, built-in tables (which were made by
      pcre_maketables() when PCRE was
      compiled). You might want to do this if you are using a
      non-standard locale. The function yields a pointer to the
      tables.
There is a complete description of the PCRE native API in
      the pcreapi(3) page and a
      description of the POSIX API in the pcreposix(3) page.
