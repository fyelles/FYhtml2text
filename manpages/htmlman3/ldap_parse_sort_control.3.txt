Synopsis

#include <ldap.h>

char **attribute);

           
        

 
LIBRARY

DESCRIPTION
This function is used to parse the results returned in a
      search operation that uses a server-side sort control.
It takes a null terminated array of LDAPControl structures
      usually obtained by a call to the ldap_parse_result function. A returncode
      which points to the sort control result code,and an array of
      LDAPControl structures that list the client controls to use
      with the search. The function also takes an out parameter
      attribute and if the
      sort operation fails, the server may return a string that
      indicates the first attribute in the sortKey list that caused
      the failure. If this parameter is NULL, no string is
      returned. If a string is returned, the memory should be freed
      by calling the ldap_memfree function.
