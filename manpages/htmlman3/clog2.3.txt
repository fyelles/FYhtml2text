Name
clog2, clog2f, clog2l — base-2 logarithm of a
      complex number

Synopsis

#include <complex.h>

double complex
            clog2(
double complex z);

           
        

float complex
            clog2f(
float complex z);

           
        

long double complex
            clog2l(
long double complex z);

           
        

 
DESCRIPTION
The call clog2(z) is equivalent to
      clog(z)/log(2).
The other functions perform the same task for float and long
      double.
Note that z close
      to zero will cause an overflow.

 
CONFORMING TO

      C99.
