LIBRARY
OpenLDAP LDAP (libldap, −lldap)

 
DESCRIPTION
These routines are used to parse results received from
      ldap_result(3) or the
      synchronous LDAP search operation routines ldap_search_s(3) and
      ldap_search_st(3).
The ldap_first_entry()
      routine is used to retrieve the first entry in a chain of
      search results. It takes the result as returned by a call to
      ldap_result(3) or ldap_search_s(3) or
      ldap_search_st(3) and
      returns a pointer to the first entry in the result.
This pointer should be supplied on a subsequent call to
      ldap_next_entry() to get the
      next entry, the result of which should be supplied to the
      next call to ldap_next_entry(), etc.
      ldap_next_entry() will return
      NULL when there are no more entries. The entries returned
      from these calls are used in calls to the routines described
      in ldap_get_dn(3), ldap_first_attribute(3),
      ldap_get_values(3),
      etc.
A count of the number of entries in the search result can
      be obtained by calling ldap_count_entries().

 
ERRORS
If an error occurs in ldap_first_entry() or ldap_next_entry(), NULL is
      returned and the ld_errno field in the ld parameter is set to indicate
      the error. If an error occurs in ldap_count_entries(), -1 is
      returned, and ld_errno is set
      appropriately. See ldap_error(3) for a
      description of possible error codes.
