Synopsis

#include <pcre.h>

int
            pcre_get_substring_list(
const char *subject,

 
int *ovector,

 
int stringcount,

 
const char ***listptr);

           
        

 
DESCRIPTION
This is a convenience function for extracting a list of
      all the captured substrings. The arguments are:

 subject       Subject that has been successfully matched
 ovector       Offset vector that pcre_exec used
 stringcount   Value returned by pcre_exec
 listptr       Where to put a pointer to the list

The memory in which the substrings and the list are placed
      is obtained by calling pcre_malloc(). The convenience function
      pcre_free_substring_list() can
      be used to free it when it is no longer needed. A pointer to
      a list of pointers is put in the variable whose address is in
      listptr. The list is
      terminated by a NULL pointer. The yield of the function is
      zero on success or PCRE_ERROR_NOMEMORY if sufficient memory
      could not be obtained.
There is a complete description of the PCRE native API in
      the pcreapi(3) page and a
      description of the POSIX API in the pcreposix(3) page.
