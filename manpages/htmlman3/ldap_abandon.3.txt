LIBRARY
OpenLDAP LDAP (libldap, −lldap)

 
DESCRIPTION
The ldap_abandon_ext()
      routine is used to send a LDAP Abandon request for an
      operation in progress. The msgid passed should be the
      message id of an outstanding LDAP operation, such as returned
      by ldap_search_ext(3).
ldap_abandon_ext() checks to
      see if the result of the operation has already come in. If it
      has, it deletes it from the queue of pending messages. If
      not, it sends an LDAP abandon request to the LDAP server.
The caller can expect that the result of an abandoned
      operation will not be returned from a future call to
      ldap_result(3).
ldap_abandon_ext() allows
      server and client controls to be passed in via the sctrls and cctrls parameters,
      respectively.
ldap_abandon_ext() returns a
      code indicating success or, in the case of failure, the
      nature of the failure. See ldap_error(3) for
      details.

 
DEPRECATED INTERFACES
The ldap_abandon() routine
      is deprecated in favor of the ldap_abandon_ext() routine.
Deprecated interfaces generally remain in the library. The
      macro LDAP_DEPRECATED can be defined to a non-zero value
      (e.g., -DLDAP_DEPRECATED=1) when compiling program designed
      to use deprecated interfaces. It is recommended that
      developers writing new programs, or updating old programs,
      avoid use of deprecated interfaces. Over time, it is expected
      that documentation (and, eventually, support) for deprecated
      interfaces to be eliminated.
