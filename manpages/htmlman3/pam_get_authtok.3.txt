DESCRIPTION
The pam_get_authtok function
      returns the cached authentication token, or prompts the user
      if no token is currently cached. It is intended for internal
      use by Linux-PAM and PAM service modules. Upon successful
      return, authtok
      contains a pointer to the value of the authentication token.
      Note, this is a pointer to the actual data and should
      not be free()'ed or over-written!
The prompt argument
      specifies a prompt to use if no token is cached. If a NULL
      pointer is given, pam_get_authtok uses pre-defined
      prompts.
The following values are supported for item:

PAM_AUTHTOK

Returns the current authentication token. Called
            from pam_sm_chauthtok(3)
pam_get_authtok will ask
            the user to confirm the new token by retyping it. If a
            prompt was specified, "Retype" will be used as
            prefix.

PAM_OLDAUTHTOK

Returns the previous authentication token when
            changing authentication tokens.

The pam_get_authtok_noverify
      function can only be used for changing the password (from
      pam_sm_chauthtok(3)). It
      returns the cached authentication token, or prompts the user
      if no token is currently cached. The difference to
      pam_get_authtok is, that this
      function does not ask a second time for the password to
      verify it. Upon successful return, authtok contains a pointer to the
      value of the authentication token. Note, this is a pointer to
      the actual data and
      should not be
      free()'ed or
      over-written!
The pam_get_authtok_verify
      function can only be used to verify a password for mistypes
      gotten by pam_get_authtok_noverify(3).
      This function asks a second time for the password and verify
      it with the password provided by authtok argument. In case of an
      error, the value of authtok is undefined. Else this
      argument will point to the actual data and should
      not be free()'ed or over-written!

 
OPTIONS
pam_get_authtok honours the
      following module options:

try_first_pass

Before prompting the user for their password, the
            module first tries the previous stacked module's
            password in case that satisfies this module as
            well.

use_first_pass

The argument use_first_pass forces the module to use
            a previous stacked modules password and will never
            prompt the user - if no password is available or the
            password is not appropriate, the user will be denied
            access.

use_authtok

When password changing enforce the module to set the
            new token to the one provided by a previously stacked
            password module. If no
            token is available token changing will fail.

authtok_type=XXX

The default action is for the module to use the
            following prompts when requesting passwords: "New UNIX
            password: " and "Retype UNIX password: ". The example
            word UNIX can be
            replaced with this option, by default it is empty.

 
RETURN VALUES

PAM_AUTH_ERR

Authentication token could not be retrieved.

PAM_AUTHTOK_ERR

New authentication could not be retrieved.

PAM_SUCCESS

Authentication token was successfully retrieved.

PAM_SYSTEM_ERR

No space for an authentication token was
            provided.

PAM_TRY_AGAIN

New authentication tokens mismatch.
