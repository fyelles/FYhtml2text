Since

DESCRIPTION
The stpncpy() function
      copies at most n
      characters from the string pointed to by src, including the terminating
      null byte ('\0'), to the array pointed to by dest. Exactly n characters are written at
      dest. If the length
      strlen(src) is
      smaller than n, the
      remaining characters in the array pointed to by dest are filled with null bytes
      ('\0'), If the length strlen(src) is greater or
      equal to n, the
      string pointed to by dest will not be
      null-terminated.
The strings may not overlap.
The programmer must ensure that there is room for at least
      n characters at
      dest.

 
RETURN VALUE
stpncpy() returns a pointer
      to the terminating null byte in dest, or, if dest is not null-terminated,
      dest + n.

 
CONFORMING TO
This function was added to POSIX.1-2008. Before that, it
      was a GNU extension.
