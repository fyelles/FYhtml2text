      authentication

Synopsis

 

#define PAM_SM_AUTH

#include <security/pam_modules.h>

PAM_EXTERN int
            pam_sm_authenticate(
pam_handle_t *pamh,

 
int flags,

 
int argc,

 
const char **argv);

           
        

 
DESCRIPTION
The pam_sm_authenticate
      function is the service module's implementation of the
      pam_authenticate(3)
      interface.
This function performs the task of authenticating the
      user.
Valid flags, which may be logically OR'd with PAM_SILENT, are:

PAM_SILENT

Do not emit any messages.

PAM_DISALLOW_NULL_AUTHTOK

Return PAM_AUTH_ERR if the database
            of authentication tokens for this authentication
            mechanism has a NULL entry for the user.
            Without this flag, such a NULL token will lead to a
            success without the user being prompted.

 
RETURN VALUES

PAM_AUTH_ERR

Authentication failure.

PAM_CRED_INSUFFICIENT

For some reason the application does not have
            sufficient credentials to authenticate the user.

PAM_AUTHINFO_UNAVAIL

The modules were not able to access the
            authentication information. This might be due to a
            network or hardware failure etc.

PAM_SUCCESS

The authentication token was successfully
            updated.

PAM_USER_UNKNOWN

The supplied username is not known to the
            authentication service.

PAM_MAXTRIES

One or more of the authentication modules has
            reached its limit of tries authenticating the user. Do
            not try again.
