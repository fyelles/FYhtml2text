DESCRIPTION
These routines are used to step through the continuation
      references in a result chain received from ldap_result(3) or the
      synchronous LDAP search operation routines.
The ldap_first_reference()
      routine is used to retrieve the first reference message in a
      result chain. It takes the result as returned by a call to
      ldap_result(3), ldap_search_s(3) or
      ldap_search_st(3) and
      returns a pointer to the first reference message in the
      result chain.
This pointer should be supplied on a subsequent call to
      ldap_next_reference() to get
      the next reference message, the result of which should be
      supplied to the next call to ldap_next_reference(), etc.
      ldap_next_reference() will
      return NULL when there are no more reference messages. The
      reference messages returned from these calls are used by
      ldap_parse_reference(3) to
      extract referrals and controls.
A count of the number of reference messages in the search
      result can be obtained by calling ldap_count_references(). It can also
      be used to count the number of reference messages remaining
      in a result chain.

 
ERRORS
If an error occurs in ldap_first_reference() or ldap_next_reference(), NULL is
      returned. If an error occurs in ldap_count_references(), -1 is
      returned.
