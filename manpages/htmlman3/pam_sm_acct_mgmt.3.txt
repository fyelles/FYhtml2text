DESCRIPTION
The pam_sm_acct_mgmt
      function is the service module's implementation of the
      pam_acct_mgmt(3)
      interface.
This function performs the task of establishing whether
      the user is permitted to gain access at this time. It should
      be understood that the user has previously been validated by
      an authentication module. This function checks for other
      things. Such things might be: the time of day or the date,
      the terminal line, remote hostname, etc. This function may
      also determine things like the expiration on passwords, and
      respond that the user change it before continuing.
Valid flags, which may be logically OR'd with PAM_SILENT, are:

PAM_SILENT

Do not emit any messages.

PAM_DISALLOW_NULL_AUTHTOK

Return PAM_AUTH_ERR if the database
            of authentication tokens for this authentication
            mechanism has a NULL entry for the user.

 
RETURN VALUES

PAM_ACCT_EXPIRED

User account has expired.

PAM_AUTH_ERR

Authentication failure.

PAM_NEW_AUTHTOK_REQD

The user's authentication token has expired. Before
            calling this function again the application will
            arrange for a new one to be given. This will likely
            result in a call to pam_sm_chauthtok().

PAM_PERM_DENIED

Permission denied.

PAM_SUCCESS

The authentication token was successfully
            updated.

PAM_USER_UNKNOWN

User unknown to password service.
