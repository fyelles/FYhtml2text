Name
pam_putenv — set or change PAM environment
      variable

Synopsis

 

#include <security/pam_appl.h>

int
            pam_putenv(
pam_handle_t *pamh,

 
const char *name_value);

           
        

 
DESCRIPTION
The pam_putenv function is
      used to add or change the value of PAM environment variables
      as associated with the pamh handle.
The pamh argument
      is an authentication handle obtained by a prior call to
      pam_start(). The name_value argument is a single
      NUL terminated string of one of the following forms:

NAME=value of variable

In this case the environment variable of the given
            NAME is set to the indicated value: value of variable. If this
            variable is already known, it is overwritten. Otherwise
            it is added to the PAM environment.

NAME=

This function sets the variable to an empty value.
            It is listed separately to indicate that this is the
            correct way to achieve such a setting.

NAME

Without an '=' the pam_putenv() function will delete the
            corresponding variable from the PAM environment.

pam_putenv() operates on a
      copy of name_value,
      which means in contrast to putenv(3), the application
      is responsible to free the data.

 
RETURN VALUES

PAM_PERM_DENIED

Argument name_value given is a NULL
            pointer.

PAM_BAD_ITEM

Variable requested (for deletion) is not currently
            set.

PAM_ABORT

The pamh
            handle is corrupt.

PAM_BUF_ERR

Memory buffer error.

PAM_SUCCESS

The environment variable was successfully
            updated.
