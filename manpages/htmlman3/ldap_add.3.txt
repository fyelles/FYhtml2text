DESCRIPTION
The ldap_add_ext_s() routine
      is used to perform an LDAP add operation. It takes dn, the DN of the entry to add,
      and attrs, a
      null-terminated array of the entry's attributes. The LDAPMod
      structure is used to represent attributes, with the
      mod_type and mod_values fields being used as described
      under ldap_modify_ext(3), and the
      ldap_op field being used only
      if you need to specify the LDAP_MOD_BVALUES option.
      Otherwise, it should be set to zero.
Note that all entries except that specified by the last
      component in the given DN must already exist. ldap_add_ext_s() returns an code indicating
      success or, in the case of failure, indicating the nature of
      failure of the operation. See ldap_error(3) for more
      details.
The ldap_add_ext() routine
      works just like ldap_add_ext_s(), but it is
      asynchronous. It returns the message id of the request it
      initiated. The result of this operation can be obtained by
      calling ldap_result(3).

 
DEPRECATED INTERFACES
The ldap_add() and
      ldap_add_s() routines are
      deprecated in favor of the ldap_add_ext() and ldap_add_ext_s() routines,
      respectively.
Deprecated interfaces generally remain in the library. The
      macro LDAP_DEPRECATED can be defined to a non-zero value
      (e.g., -DLDAP_DEPRECATED=1) when compiling program designed
      to use deprecated interfaces. It is recommended that
      developers writing new programs, or updating old programs,
      avoid use of deprecated interfaces. Over time, it is expected
      that documentation (and, eventually, support) for deprecated
      interfaces to be eliminated.
