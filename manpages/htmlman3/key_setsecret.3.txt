DESCRIPTION
The functions here are used within the RPC's secure
      authentication mechanism (AUTH_DES). There should be no need
      for user programs to use this functions.
The function key_decryptsession() uses the (remote)
      server netname and takes the DES key for decrypting. It uses
      the public key of the server and the secret key associated
      with the effective UID of the calling process.
The function key_encryptsession() is the inverse of
      key_decryptsession(). It
      encrypts the DES keys with the public key of the server and
      the secret key associated with the effective UID of the
      calling process.
The function key_gendes() is
      used to ask the keyserver for a secure conversation key.
The function key_setsecret()
      is used to set the key for the effective UID of the calling
      process.
The function key_secretkey_is_set() can be used to
      determine whether a key has been set for the effective UID of
      the calling process.

 
RETURN VALUE
These functions return 1 on success and 0 on failure.

 
NOTES
Note that we talk about two types of encryption here. One
      is asymmetric using a public and secret key. The other is
      symmetric, the 64-bit DES.
These routines were part of the Linux/Doors-project,
      abandoned by now.
