Name
wcstombs — convert a wide-character string to a
      multibyte string

Synopsis

#include <stdlib.h>

size_t
            wcstombs(
char *dest,

 
const wchar_t *src,

 
size_t n);

           
        

 
DESCRIPTION
If dest is not a
      NULL pointer, the wcstombs()
      function converts the wide-character string src to a multibyte string
      starting at dest. At
      most n bytes are
      written to dest. The
      conversion starts in the initial state. The conversion can
      stop for three reasons:

A wide character has been encountered that can not
            be represented as a multibyte sequence (according to
            the current locale). In this case (size_t) −1 is
            returned.

The length limit forces a stop. In this case the
            number of bytes written to dest is returned, but the
            shift state at this point is lost.

The wide-character string has been completely
            converted, including the terminating null wide
            character (L'\0'). In this case the conversion ends in
            the initial state. The number of bytes written to
            dest, excluding
            the terminating null, is returned.

The programmer must ensure that there is room for at least
      n bytes at dest.
If dest is NULL,
      n is ignored, and the
      conversion proceeds as above, except that the converted bytes
      are not written out to memory, and that no length limit
      exists.
In order to avoid the case 2 above, the programmer should
      make sure n is
      greater or equal to wcstombs(NULL,src,0)+1.

 
RETURN VALUE
The wcstombs() function
      returns the number of bytes that make up the converted part
      of multibyte sequence, not including the terminating null
      byte. If a wide character was encountered which could not be
      converted, (size_t)
      −1 is returned.

 
CONFORMING TO
C99.

 
NOTES
The behavior of wcstombs()
      depends on the LC_CTYPE
      category of the current locale.
The function wcsrtombs(3) provides a
      thread safe interface to the same functionality.
