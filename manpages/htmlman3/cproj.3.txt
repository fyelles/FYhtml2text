DESCRIPTION
This function projects a point in the plane onto the
      surface of a Riemann Sphere, the one-point compactification
      of the complex plane. Each finite point z projects to z itself. Every complex
      infinite value is projected to a single infinite value,
      namely to positive infinity on the real axis.

 
VERSIONS
These functions first appeared in glibc in version
      2.1.

 
CONFORMING TO
C99.

 
NOTES
In glibc 2.11 and earlier, the implementation does
      something different (a stereographic projection onto a Riemann
      Sphere).
