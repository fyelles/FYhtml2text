LIBRARY
OpenLDAP LDAP (libldap, −lldap)

 
DESCRIPTION
These routines support the use of LDAP URLs (Uniform
      Resource Locators) as detailed in RFC 4516. LDAP URLs look
      like this:

  ldap://hostport/dn[?attrs[?scope[?filter[?exts]]]]

where:
  hostport is a host name with an optional ":portnumber"
  dn is the search base
  attrs is a comma separated list of attributes to request
  scope is one of these three strings:
    base one sub (default=base)
  filter is filter
  exts are recognized set of LDAP and/or API extensions.

Example:
  ldap://ldap.example.net/dc=example,dc=net?cn,sn?sub?(cn=*)

URLs that are wrapped in angle-brackets and/or preceded by
      "URL:" are also tolerated. Alternative LDAP schemes such as
      ldaps:// and ldapi:// may be parsed using the below routines
      as well.
ldap_is_ldap_url() returns a
      non-zero value if url
      looks like an LDAP URL (as opposed to some other kind of
      URL). It can be used as a quick check for an LDAP URL; the
      ldap_url_parse() routine should
      be used if a more thorough check is needed.
ldap_url_parse() breaks down
      an LDAP URL passed in url into its component pieces.
      If successful, zero is returned, an LDAP URL description is
      allocated, filled in, and ludpp is set to point to it. If
      an error occurs, a non-zero URL error code is returned.
ldap_free_urldesc() should
      be called to free an LDAP URL description that was obtained
      from a call to ldap_url_parse().
