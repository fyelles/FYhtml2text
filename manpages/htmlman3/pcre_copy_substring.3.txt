int
            pcre_copy_substring(
const char *subject,

char *buffer,

 
int buffersize);

           
        

 
DESCRIPTION
This is a convenience function for extracting a captured
      substring into a given buffer. The arguments are:

 subject       Subject that has been successfully matched
 ovector       Offset vector that pcre_exec() used
 stringcount   Value returned by pcre_exec()
 stringnumber  Number of the required substring
 buffer        Buffer to receive the string
 buffersize    Size of buffer

The yield is the length of the string, PCRE_ERROR_NOMEMORY
      if the buffer was too small, or PCRE_ERROR_NOSUBSTRING if the
      string number is invalid.
There is a complete description of the PCRE native API in
      the pcreapi(3) page and a
      description of the POSIX API in the pcreposix(3) page.
