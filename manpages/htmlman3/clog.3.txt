Name
clog, clogf, clogl — natural logarithm of a complex
      number

Synopsis

#include <complex.h>

double complex
            clog(
double complex z);

           
        

float complex
            clogf(
float complex z);

           
        

long double complex
            clogl(
long double complex z);

DESCRIPTION
The logarithm clog() is the
      inverse function of the exponential cexp(3). Thus, if
      y = clog(z), then
      z = cexp(y). The
      imaginary part of y is chosen in
      the interval [−pi,pi].
One has:

    clog(z) = log(cabs(z)) + I * carg(z)

Note that z close
      to zero will cause an overflow.

 
VERSIONS
These functions first appeared in glibc in version
      2.1.

 
CONFORMING TO
C99.
