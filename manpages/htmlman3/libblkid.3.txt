Name
libblkid — block device identification library

Synopsis

#include <blkid.h>

cc file.c −lblkid
  

 
DESCRIPTION
The libblkid library is used
      to identify block devices (disks) as to their content (e.g.
      filesystem type) as well as extracting additional information
      such as filesystem labels/volume names, unique
      identifiers/serial numbers, etc. A common use is to allow use
      of LABEL= and UUID= tags instead of hard-coding specific
      block device names into configuration files.
Block device information is normally kept in a cache file
      /etc/blkid.tab and is verified
      to still be valid before being returned to the user (if the
      user has read permission on the raw block device, otherwise
      not). The cache file also allows unprivileged users (normally
      anyone other than root, or those not in the "disk" group) to
      locate devices by label/id. The standard location of the
      cache file can be overridden by the environment variable
      BLKID_FILE.
In situations where one is getting information about a
      single known device, it does not impact performance whether
      the cache is used or not (unless you are not able to read the
      block device directly). If you are dealing with multiple
      devices, use of the cache is highly recommended (even if
      empty) as devices will be scanned at most one time and the
      on-disk cache will be updated if possible. There is rarely a
      reason not to use the cache.
In some cases (modular kernels), block devices are not
      even visible until after they are accessed the first time, so
      it is critical that there is some way to locate these devices
      without enumerating only visible devices, so the use of the
      cache file is required in this
      situation.

 
CONFIGURATION FILE
The standard location of the /etc/blkid.conf config file can be
      overridden by the environment variable BLKID_CONF. The
      following options control the libblkid library:

SEND_UEVENT=<yes|not>

Sends uevent when /dev/disk/by-{label,uuid}/ symlink
            does not match with LABEL or UUID on the device.
            Default is "yes".

CACHE_FILE=<path>

Overrides the standard location of the cache file.
            This setting can be overridden by the environment
            variable BLKID_FILE. Default is /etc/blkid.tab.

EVALUATE=<methods>

Defines LABEL and UUID evaluation method(s).
            Currently, the libblkid library supports "udev" and
            "scan" methods. More than one methods may be specified
            in a comma separated list. Default is "udev,scan". The
            "udev" method uses udev /dev/disk/by-* symlinks and the
            "scan" method scans all block devices from the
            /proc/partitions
            file.

 
AUTHOR
libblkid was written by
      Andreas Dilger for the ext2 filesystem utilties, with input
      from Ted Ts'o. The library was subsequently heavily modified
      by Ted Ts'o.
The low-level probing code was rewritten by Karel Zak.
