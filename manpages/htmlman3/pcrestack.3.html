      <h2>PCRE DISCUSSION OF STACK USAGE</h2>

      <p>When you call <code class="function">pcre_exec</code>(),
      it makes use of an internal function called <code class="function">match</code>(). This calls itself recursively at
      branch points in the pattern, in order to remember the state
      of the match so that it can back up and try a different
      alternative if the first one fails. As matching proceeds
      deeper and deeper into the tree of possibilities, the
      recursion depth increases. The <code class="function">match</code>() function is also called in other
      circumstances, for example, whenever a parenthesized
      sub-pattern is entered, and in certain cases of
      repetition.</p>

      <p>Not all calls of <code class="function">match</code>()
      increase the recursion depth; for an item such as a* it may
      be called several times at the same level, after matching
      different numbers of a's. Furthermore, in a number of cases
      where the result of the recursive call would immediately be
      passed back as the result of the current call (a "tail
      recursion"), the function is just restarted instead.</p>

      <p>The <code class="function">pcre_dfa_exec</code>() function
      operates in an entirely different way, and uses recursion
      only when there is a regular expression recursion or
      subroutine call in the pattern. This includes the processing
      of assertion and "once-only" subpatterns, which are handled
      like subroutine calls. Normally, these are never very deep,
      and the limit on the complexity of <code class="function">pcre_dfa_exec</code>() is controlled by the amount
      of workspace it is given. However, it is possible to write
      patterns with runaway infinite recursions; such patterns will
      cause <code class="function">pcre_dfa_exec</code>() to run
      out of stack. At present, there is no protection against
      this.</p>

      <p>The comments that follow do NOT apply to <code class="function">pcre_dfa_exec</code>(); they are relevant only for
      <code class="function">pcre_exec</code>().</p>

      <div class="refsect2" title="Reducing pcre_exec()'s stack usage">
        <a id="pcrestack-3_sect2" name="pcrestack-3_sect2" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>Reducing <code class="function">pcre_exec</code>()'s
        stack usage</h3>

        <p>Each time that <code class="function">match</code>() is
        actually called recursively, it uses memory from the
        process stack. For certain kinds of pattern and data, very
        large amounts of stack may be needed, despite the
        recognition of "tail recursion". You can often reduce the
        amount of recursion, and therefore the amount of stack
        used, by modifying the pattern that is being matched.
        Consider, for example, this pattern:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
([^&lt;]|&lt;(?!inet))+
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>It matches from wherever it starts until it encounters
        "&lt;inet" or the end of the data, and is the kind of
        pattern that might be used when processing an XML file.
        Each iteration of the outer parentheses matches either one
        character that is not "&lt;" or a "&lt;" that is not
        followed by "inet". However, each time a parenthesis is
        processed, a recursion occurs, so this formulation uses a
        stack frame for each matched character. For a long string,
        a lot of stack is required. Consider now this rewritten
        pattern, which matches exactly the same strings:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
([^&lt;]++|&lt;(?!inet))+
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>This uses very much less stack, because runs of
        characters that do not contain "&lt;" are "swallowed" in
        one item inside the parentheses. Recursion happens only
        when a "&lt;" character that is not followed by "inet" is
        encountered (and we assume this is relatively rare). A
        possessive quantifier is used to stop any backtracking into
        the runs of non-"&lt;" characters, but that is not related
        to stack usage.</p>

        <p>This example shows that one way of avoiding stack
        problems when matching long subject strings is to write
        repeated parenthesized subpatterns to match more than one
        character whenever possible.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="refsect2" title="Compiling PCRE to use heap instead of stack for pcre_exec()">
      <a id="pcrestack-3_sect3" name="pcrestack-3_sect3" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>Compiling PCRE to use heap instead of stack for
        <code class="function">pcre_exec</code>()</h3>

        <p>In environments where stack memory is constrained, you
        might want to compile PCRE to use heap memory instead of
        stack for remembering back-up points when <code class="function">pcre_exec</code>() is running. This makes it run
        a lot more slowly, however. Details of how to do this are
        given in the <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcrebuild.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcrebuild</span>(3)</span></a>
        documentation. When built in this way, instead of using the
        stack, PCRE obtains and frees memory by calling the
        functions that are pointed to by the <code class="function">pcre_stack_malloc</code> and <code class="function">pcre_stack_free</code> variables. By default,
        these point to <code class="function">malloc</code>() and
        <code class="function">free</code>(), but you can replace
        the pointers to cause PCRE to use your own functions. Since
        the block sizes are always the same, and are always freed
        in reverse order, it may be possible to implement
        customized memory handlers that are more efficient than the
        standard functions.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="refsect2" title="Limiting pcre_exec()'s stack usage">
        <a id="pcrestack-3_sect4" name="pcrestack-3_sect4" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>Limiting <code class="function">pcre_exec</code>()'s
        stack usage</h3>

        <p>You can set limits on the number of times that
        <code class="function">match</code>() is called, both in
        total and recursively. If a limit is exceeded, <code class="function">pcre_exec</code>() returns an error code.
        Setting suitable limits should prevent it from running out
        of stack. The default values of the limits are very large,
        and unlikely ever to operate. They can be changed when PCRE
        is built, and they can also be set when <code class="function">pcre_exec</code>() is called. For details of
        these interfaces, see the <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcrebuild.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcrebuild</span>(3)</span></a>
        documentation and the section on extra data for
        <code class="function">pcre_exec</code>() in the <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcreapi.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcreapi</span>(3)</span></a>
        documentation.</p>

        <p>As a very rough rule of thumb, you should reckon on
        about 500 bytes per recursion. Thus, if you want to limit
        your stack usage to 8Mb, you should set the limit at 16000
        recursions. A 64Mb stack, on the other hand, can support
        around 128000 recursions.</p>

        <p>In Unix-like environments, the <span class="command"><strong>pcretest</strong></span> test program has
        a command line option (<code class="option">−S</code>) that can be used to increase the
        size of its stack. As long as the stack is large enough,
        another option (<code class="option">−M</code>) can
        be used to find the smallest limits that allow a particular
        pattern to match a given subject string. This is done by
        calling <code class="function">pcre_exec</code>()
        repeatedly with different limits.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="refsect2" title="Changing stack size in Unix-like systems">
        <a id="pcrestack-3_sect5" name="pcrestack-3_sect5" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>Changing stack size in Unix-like systems</h3>

        <p>In Unix-like environments, there is not often a problem
        with the stack unless very long strings are involved,
        though the default limit on stack size varies from system
        to system. Values from 8Mb to 64Mb are common. You can find
        your default limit by running the command:</p>

        <p>ulimit -s Unfortunately, the effect of running out of
        stack is often SIGSEGV, though sometimes a more explicit
        error message is given. You can normally increase the limit
        on stack size by code such as this:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 struct rlimit rlim;
 getrlimit(RLIMIT_STACK, &amp;rlim);
 rlim.rlim_cur = 100*1024*1024;
 setrlimit(RLIMIT_STACK, &amp;rlim);
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>This reads the current limits (soft and hard) using
        <code class="function">getrlimit</code>(), then attempts to
        increase the soft limit to 100Mb using <code class="function">setrlimit</code>(). You must do this before
        calling <code class="function">pcre_exec</code>().</p>

        <h3>Changing stack size in Mac OS X</h3>

        <p>Using <code class="function">setrlimit</code>(), as
        described above, should also work on Mac OS X. It is also
        possible to set a stack size when linking a program. There
        is a discussion about stack sizes in Mac OS X at this web
        site: http://developer.apple.com/qa/qa2005/qa1419.html.</p>
