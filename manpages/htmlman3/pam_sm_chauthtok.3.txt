DESCRIPTION
The pam_sm_chauthtok
      function is the service module's implementation of the
      pam_chauthtok(3)
      interface.
This function is used to (re-)set the authentication token
      of the user.
Valid flags, which may be logically OR'd with PAM_SILENT, are:

PAM_SILENT

Do not emit any messages.

PAM_CHANGE_EXPIRED_AUTHTOK

This argument indicates to the module that the users
            authentication token (password) should only be changed
            if it has expired. This flag is optional and
            must be combined
            with one of the following two flags. Note, however, the
            following two options are mutually exclusive.

PAM_PRELIM_CHECK

This indicates that the modules are being probed as
            to their ready status for altering the user's
            authentication token. If the module requires access to
            another system over some network it should attempt to
            verify it can connect to this system on receiving this
            flag. If a module cannot establish it is ready to
            update the user's authentication token it should return
            PAM_TRY_AGAIN,
            this information will be passed back to the
            application.
If the control value sufficient is used in the
            password stack, the PAM_PRELIM_CHECK section of
            the modules following that control value is not always
            executed.

PAM_UPDATE_AUTHTOK

This informs the module that this is the call it
            should change the authorization tokens. If the flag is
            logically OR'd with PAM_CHANGE_EXPIRED_AUTHTOK,
            the token is only changed if it has actually
            expired.

The PAM library calls this function twice in succession.
      The first time with PAM_PRELIM_CHECK and then, if the
      module does not return PAM_TRY_AGAIN, subsequently with
      PAM_UPDATE_AUTHTOK. It
      is only on the second call that the authorization token is
      (possibly) changed.

 
RETURN VALUES

PAM_AUTHTOK_ERR

The module was unable to obtain the new
            authentication token.

PAM_AUTHTOK_RECOVERY_ERR

The module was unable to obtain the old
            authentication token.

PAM_AUTHTOK_LOCK_BUSY

Cannot change the authentication token since it is
            currently locked.

PAM_AUTHTOK_DISABLE_AGING

Authentication token aging has been disabled.

PAM_PERM_DENIED

Permission denied.

PAM_TRY_AGAIN

Preliminary check was unsuccessful. Signals an
            immediate return to the application is desired.

PAM_SUCCESS

The authentication token was successfully
            updated.

PAM_USER_UNKNOWN

User unknown to password service.
