DESCRIPTION
The pam_sm_setcred function
      is the service module's implementation of the pam_setcred(3)
      interface.
This function performs the task of altering the
      credentials of the user with respect to the corresponding
      authorization scheme. Generally, an authentication module may
      have access to more information about a user than their
      authentication token. This function is used to make such
      information available to the application. It should only be
      called after the user
      has been authenticated but before a session has been
      established.
Valid flags, which may be logically OR'd with PAM_SILENT, are:

PAM_SILENT

Do not emit any messages.

PAM_ESTABLISH_CRED

Initialize the credentials for the user.

PAM_DELETE_CRED

Delete the credentials associated with the
            authentication service.

PAM_REINITIALIZE_CRED

Reinitialize the user credentials.

PAM_REFRESH_CRED

Extend the lifetime of the user credentials.

The way the auth
      stack is navigated in order to evaluate the pam_setcred() function call, independent of
      the pam_sm_setcred() return
      codes, is exactly the same way that it was navigated when
      evaluating the pam_authenticate() library call. Typically,
      if a stack entry was ignored in evaluating pam_authenticate(), it will be ignored when
      libpam evaluates the pam_setcred() function call. Otherwise, the
      return codes from each module specific pam_sm_setcred() call are treated as
      required.

 
RETURN VALUES

PAM_CRED_UNAVAIL

This module cannot retrieve the user's
            credentials.

PAM_CRED_EXPIRED

The user's credentials have expired.

PAM_CRED_ERR

This module was unable to set the credentials of the
            user.

PAM_SUCCESS

The user credential was successfully set.

PAM_USER_UNKNOWN

The user is not known to this authentication
            module.

These, non-PAM_SUCCESS, return values will
      typically lead to the credential stack failing. The first such error will
      dominate in the return value of pam_setcred().
