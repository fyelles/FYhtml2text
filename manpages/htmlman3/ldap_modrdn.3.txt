LIBRARY
OpenLDAP LDAP (libldap, −lldap)

 
DESCRIPTION
The ldap_modrdn() and
      ldap_modrdn_s() routines
      perform an LDAP modify RDN operation. They both take
      dn, the DN of the
      entry whose RDN is to be changed, and newrdn, the new RDN to give the
      entry. The old RDN of the entry is never kept as an attribute
      of the entry. ldap_modrdn() is
      asynchronous, returning the message id of the operation it
      initiates. ldap_modrdn_s() is
      synchronous, returning the LDAP error code indicating the
      success or failure of the operation. Use of these routines is
      deprecated. Use the versions described below instead.
The ldap_modrdn2() and
      ldap_modrdn2_s() routines also
      perform an LDAP modify RDN operation, taking the same
      parameters as above. In addition, they both take the
      deleteoldrdn
      parameter which is used as a boolean value to indicate
      whether the old RDN values should be deleted from the entry
      or not.

 
ERRORS
The synchronous (_s) versions of these routines return an
      LDAP error code, either LDAP_SUCCESS or an error if there was
      trouble. The asynchronous versions return −1 in case of
      trouble, setting the ld_errno
      field of ld. See
      ldap_error(3) for more
      details.
