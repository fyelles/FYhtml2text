pam_acct_mgmt — PAM account validation
      management

Synopsis

 

#include <security/pam_appl.h>

int
            pam_acct_mgmt(
pam_handle_t *pamh,

 
int flags);

           
        

 
DESCRIPTION
The pam_acct_mgmt function
      is used to determine if the users account is valid. It checks
      for authentication token and account expiration and verifies
      access restrictions. It is typically called after the user
      has been authenticated.
The pamh argument
      is an authentication handle obtained by a prior call to
      pam_start(). The flags argument is the binary or of zero or
      more of the following values:

PAM_SILENT

Do not emit any messages.

PAM_DISALLOW_NULL_AUTHTOK

The PAM module service should return
            PAM_NEW_AUTHTOK_REQD if the user has a null
            authentication token.

 
RETURN VALUES

PAM_ACCT_EXPIRED

User account has expired.

PAM_AUTH_ERR

Authentication failure.

PAM_NEW_AUTHTOK_REQD

The user account is valid but their authentication
            token is expired. The correct
            response to this return-value is to require that the
            user satisfies the pam_chauthtok() function before
            obtaining service. It may not be possible for some
            applications to do this. In such cases, the user should
            be denied access until such time as they can update
            their password.

PAM_PERM_DENIED

Permission denied.

PAM_SUCCESS

The authentication token was successfully
            updated.

PAM_USER_UNKNOWN

User unknown to password service.
