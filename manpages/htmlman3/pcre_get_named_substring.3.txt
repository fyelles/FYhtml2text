Synopsis

#include <pcre.h>

int
            pcre_get_named_substring(
const pcre *code,

 
const char *subject,

 
int *ovector,

 
int stringcount,

 
const char *stringname,

 
const char **stringptr);

           
        

 
DESCRIPTION
This is a convenience function for extracting a captured
      substring by name. The arguments are:

 code          Compiled pattern
 subject       Subject that has been successfully matched
 ovector       Offset vector that pcre_exec() used
 stringcount   Value returned by pcre_exec()
 stringname    Name of the required substring
 stringptr     Where to put the string pointer

The memory in which the substring is placed is obtained by
      calling pcre_malloc(). The
      convenience function pcre_free_substring() can be used to free
      it when it is no longer needed. The yield of the function is
      the length of the extracted substring, PCRE_ERROR_NOMEMORY if
      sufficient memory could not be obtained, or
      PCRE_ERROR_NOSUBSTRING if the string name is invalid.
There is a complete description of the PCRE native API in
      the pcreapi(3) page and a
      description of the POSIX API in the pcreposix(3) page.
