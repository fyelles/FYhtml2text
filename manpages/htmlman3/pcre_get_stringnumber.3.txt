int
            pcre_get_stringnumber(
const pcre *code,

 
const char *name);

           
        

 
DESCRIPTION
This convenience function finds the number of a named
      substring capturing parenthesis in a compiled pattern. Its
      arguments are:

 code    Compiled regular expression
 name    Name whose number is required

The yield of the function is the number of the parenthesis
      if the name is found, or PCRE_ERROR_NOSUBSTRING otherwise.
      When duplicate names are allowed (PCRE_DUPNAMES is set), it
      is not defined which of the numbers is returned by
      pcre_get_stringnumber(). You
      can obtain the complete list by calling pcre_get_stringtable_entries().
There is a complete description of the PCRE native API in
      the pcreapi(3) page and a
      description of the POSIX API in the pcreposix(3) page.
