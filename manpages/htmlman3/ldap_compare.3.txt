LIBRARY
OpenLDAP LDAP (libldap, −lldap)

 
DESCRIPTION
The ldap_compare_ext_s()
      routine is used to perform an LDAP compare operation
      synchronously. It takes dn, the DN of the entry upon
      which to perform the compare, and attr and value, the attribute description and value
      to compare to those found in the entry. It returns a code,
      which will be LDAP_COMPARE_TRUE if the entry contains the
      attribute value and LDAP_COMPARE_FALSE if it does not.
      Otherwise, an error code is returned that indicates the
      nature of the problem. See ldap(3) for details.
The ldap_compare_ext()
      routine is used to perform an LDAP compare operation
      asynchronously. It takes the same parameters as ldap_compare_ext_s(), but
      provides the message id of the request it initiated in the
      integer pointed to msgidp. The result of the
      compare can be obtained by a subsequent call to ldap_result(3).
Both routines allow server and client controls to be
      specified to extend the compare request.

 
DEPRECATED INTERFACES
The routines ldap_compare()
      and ldap_compare_s() are
      deprecated in favor of ldap_compare_ext() and ldap_compare_ext_s(), respectively.
Deprecated interfaces generally remain in the library. The
      macro LDAP_DEPRECATED can be defined to a non-zero value
      (e.g., -DLDAP_DEPRECATED=1) when compiling program designed
      to use deprecated interfaces. It is recommended that
      developers writing new programs, or updating old programs,
      avoid use of deprecated interfaces. Over time, it is expected
      that documentation (and, eventually, support) for deprecated
      interfaces to be eliminated.
