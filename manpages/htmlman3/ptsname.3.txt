DESCRIPTION
The ptsname() function
      returns the name of the slave pseudoterminal device
      corresponding to the master referred to by fd.
The ptsname_r() function is
      the reentrant equivalent of ptsname(). It returns the name of the slave
      pseudoterminal device as a null-terminated string in the
      buffer pointed to by buf. The buflen argument specifies the
      number of bytes available in buf.

 
RETURN VALUE
On success, ptsname()
      returns a pointer to a string in static storage which will be
      overwritten by subsequent calls. This pointer must not be
      freed. On failure, a NULL pointer is returned.
On success, ptsname_r()
      returns 0. On failure, a nonzero value is returned and
      errno is set to indicate the
      error.

 
ERRORS

EINVAL

(ptsname_r() only)
            buf is
            NULL.

ENOTTY

fd does not
            refer to a pseudoterminal master device.

ERANGE

(ptsname_r() only)
            buf is too
            small.

 
VERSIONS
ptsname() is provided in
      glibc since version 2.1.

 
CONFORMING TO
ptsname() is part of the
      UNIX 98 pseudoterminal support (see pts(4)). This function is
      specified in POSIX.1-2001.
ptsname_r() is a Linux
      extension. A version of this function is documented on Tru64
      and HP-UX, but on those implementations, −1 is returned
      on error, with errno set to
      indicate the error. Avoid using this function in portable
      programs.
