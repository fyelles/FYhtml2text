Synopsis

#include <pcre.h>

int
            pcre_get_stringtable_entries(
const pcre *code,

 
const char *name,

 
char **first,

 
char **last);

           
        

 
DESCRIPTION
This convenience function finds, for a compiled pattern,
      the first and last entries for a given name in the table that
      translates capturing parenthesis names into numbers. When
      names are required to be unique (PCRE_DUPNAMES is
      not set), it is
      usually easier to use pcre_get_stringnumber() instead.

 code    Compiled regular expression
 name    Name whose entries required
 first   Where to return a pointer to the first entry
 last    Where to return a pointer to the last entry

The yield of the function is the length of each entry, or
      PCRE_ERROR_NOSUBSTRING if none are found.
There is a complete description of the PCRE native API,
      including the format of the table entries, in the pcreapi(3) page, and a
      description of the POSIX API in the pcreposix(3) page.
