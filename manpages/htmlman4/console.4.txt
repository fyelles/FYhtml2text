Name
console — console terminal and virtual consoles

 
DESCRIPTION
A Linux system has up to 63 virtual consoles (character
      devices with major number 4 and minor number 1 to 63),
      usually called /dev/ttyn with 1 ≤ n ≤ 63. The current
      console is also addressed by /dev/console or /dev/tty0, the character device with major
      number 4 and minor number 0. The device files /dev/* are
      usually created using the script MAKEDEV, or using mknod(1), usually with mode
      0622 and owner root.tty.
Before kernel version 1.1.54 the number of virtual
      consoles was compiled into the kernel (in tty.h: #define
      NR_CONSOLES 8) and could be changed by editing and
      recompiling. Since version 1.1.54 virtual consoles are
      created on the fly, as soon as they are needed.
Common ways to start a process on a console are: (a) tell
      init(8) (in inittab(5)) to start a
      mingetty(8) (or agetty(8)) on the console;
      (b) ask openvt(1) to start a process on
      the console; (c) start X—it will find the first unused
      console, and display its output there. (There is also the
      ancient doshell(8).)
Common ways to switch consoles are: (a) use
      Alt+Fn or
      Ctrl+Alt+Fn to
      switch to console n; AltGr+Fn might bring you to console
      n+12 [here Alt and
      AltGr refer to the left and right Alt keys, respectively];
      (b) use Alt+RightArrow or Alt+LeftArrow to cycle through the
      presently allocated consoles; (c) use the program
      chvt(1). (The key mapping is
      user settable, see loadkeys(1); the above
      mentioned key combinations are according to the default
      settings.)
The command deallocvt(1) (formerly
      disalloc) will free the memory
      taken by the screen buffers for consoles that no longer have
      any associated process.

 
Properties
Consoles carry a lot of state. I hope to document that
        some other time. The most important fact is that the
        consoles simulate vt100 terminals. In particular, a console
        is reset to the initial state by printing the two
        characters ESC c. All escape sequences can be found in
        console_codes(4).
