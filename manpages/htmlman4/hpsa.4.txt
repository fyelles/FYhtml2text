Name
hpsa — HP Smart Array SCSI driver

Synopsis

modprobe hpsa [ hpsa_allow_any=1 ]
  

 
DESCRIPTION
hpsa is a SCSI driver for HP
      Smart Array RAID controllers.

 
Options
hpsa_allow_any=1: This
        option allows the driver to attempt to operate on any HP
        Smart Array hardware RAID controller, even if it is not
        explicitly known to the driver. This allows newer hardware
        to work with older drivers. Typically this is used to allow
        installation of operating systems from media that predates
        the RAID controller, though it may also be used to enable
        hpsa to drive older
        controllers that would normally be handled by the cciss(4) driver. These
        older boards have not been tested and are not supported
        with hpsa, and cciss(4) should still be
        used for these.

 
Supported Hardware
The hpsa driver supports
        the following Smart Array boards:

    Smart Array P700M
    Smart Array P212
    Smart Array P410
    Smart Array P410i
    Smart Array P411
    Smart Array P812
    Smart Array P712m
    Smart Array P711m
    StorageWorks P1210m

 
Configuration Details
To configure HP Smart Array controllers, use the HP
        Array Configuration Utility (either hpacuxe(8) or hpacucli(8)) or the Offline
        ROM-based Configuration Utility (ORCA) run from the Smart
        Array's option ROM at boot time.

 
FILES

 
Device Nodes
Logical drives are accessed via the SCSI disk driver
        (sd(4)), tape drives via
        the SCSI tape driver (st(4)), and the RAID
        controller via the SCSI generic driver (sg(4)), with device nodes
        named /dev/sd*, /dev/st*, and /dev/sg*, respectively.

 
HPSA-Specific Host Attribute Files in /sys

/sys/class/scsi_host/host*/rescan

This is a write-only attribute. Writing to this
              attribute will cause the driver to scan for new,
              changed, or removed devices (e.g. hot-plugged tape
              drives, or newly configured or deleted logical
              drives, etc.) and notify the SCSI midlayer of any
              changes detected. Normally a rescan is triggered
              automatically by HP's Array Configuration Utility
              (either the GUI or the command-line variety); thus,
              for logical drive changes, the user should not
              normally have to use this attribute. This attribute
              may be useful when hot plugging devices like tape
              drives, or entire storage boxes containing
              pre-configured logical drives.

/sys/class/scsi_host/host*/firmware_revision

This attribute contains the firmware version of
              the Smart Array.
For example:

    # cd /sys/class/scsi_host/host4
    # cat firmware_revision
    7.14

 
HPSA-Specific Disk Attribute Files in /sys

/sys/class/scsi_disk/c:b:t:l/device/unique_id

This attribute contains a 32 hex-digit unique ID
              for each logical drive.

For example:

    # cd /sys/class/scsi_disk/4:0:0:0/device
    # cat unique_id
    600508B1001044395355323037570F77

/sys/class/scsi_disk/c:b:t:l/device/raid_level

This attribute contains the RAID level of each
              logical drive.

For example:

    # cd /sys/class/scsi_disk/4:0:0:0/device
    # cat raid_level
    RAID 0

/sys/class/scsi_disk/c:b:t:l/device/lunid

This attribute contains the 16 hex-digit (8 byte)
              LUN ID by which a logical drive or physical device
              can be addressed. c:b:t:l are
              the controller, bus, target and lun of the
              device.

For example:

    # cd /sys/class/scsi_disk/4:0:0:0/device
    # cat lunid
    0x0000004000000000

 
Supported ioctl() operations
For compatibility with applications written for the
        cciss(4) driver, many,
        but not all of the ioctls supported by the cciss(4) driver are also
        supported by the hpsa driver.
        The data structures used by these ioctls are described in
        the kernel source file include/linux/cciss_ioctl.h.

CCISS_DEREGDISK, CCISS_REGNEWDISK, CCISS_REGNEWD

These three ioctls all do exactly the same thing,
              which is to cause the driver to rescan for new
              devices. This does exactly the same thing as writing
              to the hpsa-specific host "rescan" attribute.

CCISS_GETPCIINFO

Returns PCI domain, bus, device and function and
              "board ID" (PCI subsystem ID).

CCISS_GETDRIVVER

Returns driver version in three bytes encoded
              as:

    (major_version << 16) | (minor_version << 8) |
        (subminor_version)

CCISS_PASSTHRU, CCISS_BIG_PASSTHRU

Allows "BMIC" and "CISS" commands to be passed
              through to the Smart Array. These are used
              extensively by the HP Array Configuration Utility,
              SNMP storage agents, etc. See cciss_vol_status at http://cciss.sf.net for some examples.
