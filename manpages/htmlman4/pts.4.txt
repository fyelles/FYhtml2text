Name
ptmx, pts — pseudoterminal master and slave

 
DESCRIPTION
The file /dev/ptmx is a
      character file with major number 5 and minor number 2,
      usually of mode 0666 and owner.group of root.root. It is used
      to create a pseudoterminal master and slave pair.
When a process opens /dev/ptmx, it gets a file descriptor for a
      pseudoterminal master (PTM), and a pseudoterminal slave (PTS)
      device is created in the /dev/pts directory. Each file descriptor
      obtained by opening /dev/ptmx
      is an independent PTM with its own associated PTS, whose path
      can be found by passing the descriptor to ptsname(3).
Before opening the pseudoterminal slave, you must pass the
      master's file descriptor to grantpt(3) and unlockpt(3).
Once both the pseudoterminal master and slave are open,
      the slave provides processes with an interface that is
      identical to that of a real terminal.
Data written to the slave is presented on the master
      descriptor as input. Data written to the master is presented
      to the slave as input.
In practice, pseudoterminals are used for implementing
      terminal emulators such as xterm(1), in which data read
      from the pseudoterminal master is interpreted by the
      application in the same way a real terminal would interpret
      the data, and for implementing remote-login programs such as
      sshd(8), in which data read
      from the pseudoterminal master is sent across the network to
      a client program that is connected to a terminal or terminal
      emulator.
Psuedoterminals can also be used to send input to programs
      that normally refuse to read input from pipes (such as
      su(1), and passwd(1)).

 
FILES
/dev/ptmx, /dev/pts/*

 
NOTES
The Linux support for the above (known as UNIX 98
      pseudoterminal naming) is done using the devpts file system, that should be mounted
      on /dev/pts.
Before this UNIX 98 scheme, master pseudoterminals were
      called /dev/ptyp0, ... and
      slave pseudoterminals /dev/ttyp0, ... and one needed lots of
      preallocated device nodes.
