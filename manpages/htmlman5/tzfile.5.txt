Name
tzfile — timezone information

Synopsis

#include <tzfile.h>
  

 
DESCRIPTION
The timezone information files used by tzset(3) begin with the
      magic characters "TZif" to identify then as timezone
      information files, followed by a character identifying the
      version of the file's format (as of 2005, either an ASCII NUL
      ('\0') or a '2') followed by fifteen bytes containing zeros
      reserved for future use, followed by six four-byte values of
      type long, written
      in a "standard" byte order (the high-order byte of the value
      is written first). These values are, in order:

tzh_ttisgmtcnt

The number of UTC/local indicators stored in the
            file.

tzh_ttisstdcnt

The number of standard/wall indicators stored in the
            file.

tzh_leapcnt

The number of leap seconds for which data is stored
            in the file.

tzh_timecnt

The number of "transition times" for which data is
            stored in the file.

tzh_typecnt

The number of "local time types" for which data is
            stored in the file (must not be zero).

tzh_charcnt

The number of characters of "timezone abbreviation
            strings" stored in the file.

The above header is followed by tzh_timecnt four-byte values
      of type long,
      sorted in ascending order. These values are written in
      "standard" byte order. Each is used as a transition time (as
      returned by time(2)) at which the rules
      for computing local time change. Next come tzh_timecnt one-byte values
      of type unsigned char;
      each one tells which of the different types of "local time"
      types described in the file is associated with the
      same-indexed transition time. These values serve as indices
      into an array of ttinfo structures (with
      tzh_typecnt
      entries) that appear next in the file; these structures are
      defined as follows:

                  struct
ttinfo {

 
long

                   
tt_gmtoff;
 

 
int

                   
tt_isdst;
 

 
unsigned int

                   
tt_abbrind;
 

};

Each structure is written as a four-byte value for
      tt_gmtoff of type
      long, in a standard
      byte order, followed by a one-byte value for tt_isdst and a one-byte value
      for tt_abbrind. In
      each structure, tt_gmtoff gives the number of
      seconds to be added to UTC, tt_isdst tells whether
      tm_isdst should be
      set by localtime(3), and
      tt_abbrind serves as
      an index into the array of timezone abbreviation characters
      that follow the ttinfo structure(s) in the
      file.
Then there are tzh_leapcnt pairs of
      four-byte values, written in standard byte order; the first
      value of each pair gives the time (as returned by time(2)) at which a leap
      second occurs; the second gives the total number of leap seconds
      to be applied after the given time. The pairs of values are
      sorted in ascending order by time.
Then there are tzh_ttisstdcnt standard/wall
      indicators, each stored as a one-byte value; they tell
      whether the transition times associated with local time types
      were specified as standard time or wall clock time, and are
      used when a timezone file is used in handling POSIX-style
      timezone environment variables.
Finally, there are tzh_ttisgmtcnt UTC/local
      indicators, each stored as a one-byte value; they tell
      whether the transition times associated with local time types
      were specified as UTC or local time, and are used when a
      timezone file is used in handling POSIX-style timezone
      environment variables.
localtime(3) uses the first
      standard-time ttinfo structure in the file
      (or simply the first ttinfo structure in the
      absence of a standard-time structure) if either tzh_timecnt is zero or the
      time argument is less than the first transition time recorded
      in the file.
For version-2-format timezone files, the above header and
      data is followed by a second header and data, identical in
      format except that eight bytes are used for each transition
      time or leap-second time. After the second header and data
      comes a newline-enclosed, POSIX-TZ-environment-variable-style
      string for use in handling instants after the last transition
      time stored in the file (with nothing between the newlines if
      there is no POSIX representation for such instants).
