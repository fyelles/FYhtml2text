Name
nsswitch.conf — System Databases and Name Service
      Switch configuration file

 
DESCRIPTION
Various functions in the C Library need to be configured
      to work correctly in the local environment. Traditionally,
      this was done by using files (e.g., /etc/passwd), but other nameservices (like
      the Network Information Service (NIS) and the Domain Name
      Service (DNS)) became popular, and were hacked into the C
      library, usually with a fixed search order.
The Linux libc5 with NYS support and the GNU C Library 2.x
      (libc.so.6) contain a cleaner solution of this problem. It is
      designed after a method used by Sun Microsystems in the C
      library of Solaris 2. We follow their name and call this
      scheme "Name Service Switch" (NSS). The sources for the
      "databases" and their lookup order are specified in the
      /etc/nsswitch.conf file.
The following databases are available in the NSS:

aliases

Mail aliases, used by sendmail(8). Presently
            ignored.

ethers

Ethernet numbers.

group

Groups of users, used by getgrent(3)
            functions.

hosts

Host names and numbers, used by gethostbyname(3) and
            similar functions.

netgroup

Network wide list of hosts and users, used for
            access rules. C libraries before glibc 2.1 only support
            netgroups over NIS.

networks

Network names and numbers, used by getnetent(3)
            functions.

passwd

User passwords, used by getpwent(3)
            functions.

protocols

Network protocols, used by getprotoent(3)
            functions.

publickey

Public and secret keys for Secure_RPC used by NFS
            and NIS+.

rpc

Remote procedure call names and numbers, used by
            getrpcbyname(3) and
            similar functions.

services

Network services, used by getservent(3)
            functions.

shadow

Shadow user passwords, used by getspnam(3).

An example /etc/nsswitch.conf (namely, the default
      used when /etc/nsswitch.conf is
      missing):

passwd:          compat
group:           compat
shadow:          compat

hosts:           dns [!UNAVAIL=return] files
networks:        nis [NOTFOUND=return] files
ethers:          nis [NOTFOUND=return] files
protocols:       nis [NOTFOUND=return] files
rpc:             nis [NOTFOUND=return] files
services:        nis [NOTFOUND=return] files

The first column is the database. The rest of the line
      specifies how the lookup process works. You can specify the
      way it works for each database individually.
The configuration specification for each database can
      contain two different items:

The service specification like `files', `db', or
            `nis'.

The reaction on lookup result like
            `[NOTFOUND=return]'.

For libc5 with NYS, the allowed service specifications are
      `files', `nis', and `nisplus'. For hosts, you could specify
      `dns' as extra service, for passwd and group `compat', but
      not for shadow.
For glibc, you must have a file called /lib/libnss_SERVICE.so.X for every SERVICE you are using. On a
      standard installation, you could use `files', `db', `nis',
      and `nisplus'. For hosts, you could specify `dns' as extra
      service, for passwd, group, and shadow `compat'. These
      services will not be used by libc5 with NYS. The version
      number X is 1 for glibc 2.0 and
      2 for glibc 2.1.
The second item in the specification gives the user much
      finer control on the lookup process. Action items are placed
      between two service names and are written within brackets.
      The general form is
`[' ( `!'? STATUS `=' ACTION )+ `]'
where

STATUS => success | notfound |
          unavail | tryagain
ACTION => return |
          continue

The case of the keywords is insignificant. The STATUS
      values are the results of a call to a lookup function of a
      specific service. They mean:

success

No error occurred and the wanted entry is returned.
            The default action for this is `return'.

notfound

The lookup process succeeded, but the needed value
            was not found. The default action is `continue'.

unavail

The service is permanently unavailable. This can
            either mean the needed file is not available, or, for
            DNS, the server is not available or does not allow
            queries. The default action is `continue'.

tryagain

The service is temporarily unavailable. This could
            mean a file is locked or a server currently cannot
            accept more connections. The default action is
            `continue'.

 
Interaction with +/− syntax (compat mode)
Linux libc5 without NYS does not have the name service
        switch but does allow the user some policy control. In
        /etc/passwd you could have
        entries of the form +user or +@netgroup (include the
        specified user from the NIS passwd map), −user or
        −@netgroup (exclude the specified user), and +
        (include every user, except the excluded ones, from the NIS
        passwd map). Since most people only put a + at the end of
        /etc/passwd to include
        everything from NIS, the switch provides a faster
        alternative for this case (`passwd: files nis') which
        doesn't require the single + entry in /etc/passwd, /etc/group, and /etc/shadow. If this is not sufficient,
        the NSS `compat' service provides full +/− semantics.
        By default, the source is `nis', but this may be overridden
        by specifying `nisplus' as source for the pseudo-databases
        passwd_compat,
        group_compat and
        shadow_compat.
        These pseudo-databases are only available in GNU C
        Library.

 
FILES
A service named SERVICE is implemented by a shared object
      library named libnss_SERVICE.so.X
      that resides in /lib.

/lib/libnss_nis.so.X

/lib/libnss_nisplus.so.2

NOTES
Within each process that uses nsswitch.conf, the entire
      file is read only once; if the file is later changed, the
      process will continue using the old configuration.
With Solaris, it isn't possible to link programs using the
      NSS Service statically. With Linux, this is no problem.
