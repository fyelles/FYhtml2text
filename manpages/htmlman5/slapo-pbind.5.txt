Name
slapo−pbind — proxy bind overlay to slapd

Synopsis

ETCDIR/slapd.conf
  

 
DESCRIPTION
The pbind
      overlay to slapd(8) forwards Simple
      Binds on a local database to a remote LDAP server instead of
      processing them locally. The remote connection is managed
      using an instance of the ldap backend.
The pbind
      overlay uses a subset of the ldap
      backend's config directives. They are described in more
      detail in slapd-ldap(5).

Note

This overlay is built into the ldap backend; it is not a separate
              module.

verlay pbind

This directive adds the proxy bind overlay to the
            current backend. The proxy bind overlay may be used
            with any backend, but it is mainly intended for use
            with local storage backends.
